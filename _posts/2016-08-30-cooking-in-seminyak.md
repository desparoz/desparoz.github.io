<h2>Balinese Cooking Class at The Amala</h2>

During our recent holiday in Bali, we took the <a href="http://www.theamala.com/dining/cooking-class">Balinese Cooking Class</a> at <a href="http://www.theamala.com/">the Amala Seminyak</a> resort, with head chef Wayan.

He did much the same at the adjoining vegetable market. Chef Wayan selected a piece of fish that we would cook in our class.

Afterwards we returned to the Amala, to an open air under-cover kitchen by the pool that had been carefully prepared with a stunning array of fresh spices and other ingredients. Our selected fish was taken away for cleaning and cutting. After a welcome drink, we were then guided through the preparation and cooking of ingredients, starting with the 'Base Gede' (spicy chilli paste), and continuing with Lawar Salad (green bean and chicken), Tum Ikan (main course steamed fish in banana leaf) and 'Dadar Gulung' (coconut pancake dessert).

Once we finished cooking we were seated at a beautifully laid-out table overlooking a pool in the Amala's courtyard, and our personal waiter served wine along with the delicious food that we had prepared under Chef Wayan's attentive guidance.

At the end we received a certificate, the recipes of the dishes prepared, and were able to keep our aprons. Of course, the real reward was the wonderful experience we enjoyed.

This half day experience was a superb opportunity to be guided through the preparation of what was a 5 star, 3 course meal by a master chef in a spectacular location.

We would go back to Seminyak just to do another cooking class with Wayan.
