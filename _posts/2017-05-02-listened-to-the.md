Listened to the latestÂ <em><a href="https://colinwalker.blog/2017/04/30/sonant-thoughts-episode-14-learning-together/">Sonant Thoughts</a></em> podcast by @colinwalker. Interested in his take on the newness of micro-blogging, and how it brings back the excitement of the early days of Twitter, and perhaps of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net">App.Net</a>. I get that, but I really like the Indie nature of micro.blog and that it is built atop the framework of existing blogs.
