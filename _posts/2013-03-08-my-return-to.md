<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/neNi+" align="right" width="300">In June of last year (2012) I posted about how I was concerned about how <a href="/blog/2012/06/15/reeder-for-iphone-supports-fever">Google was becoming "creepy"</a>. At that time, I decided that I didn't want any one company to have all my data. This would prevent Google (or anyone other company) having a complete picture of me, and also it would mean I wouldn't be too exposed if any one company was to go away.</p>
<p>I was also concerned that as a user of Google's services, I was more of a product than a customer. This may be the case for the <em>free</em> versions of those services, but as a paid Google Apps user, I may have over-thought this a little!</p>
<p>To achieve my move away from Google, I moved my email, calendar and address book to iCloud, and I moved my RSS feeds to a self hosted <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">Fever</a> installation. I also started playing around with alternative search engines, including <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">DuckDuckGo</a> and Bing. I thought'd it be interesting to check in with how that process has gone.</p>
<p>Let's start with search. I found DuckDuckGo and Bing to both be excellent - I was particularly surprised by Bing, which I didn't think would hold much chop. At this time, Bing is my default search engine on my iPhone, while Google plays that role on my iPad. It's not possible to make DuckDuckGo the default search engine in iOS, but I do use the app, and have made it the default on my MacBook. All are good, but in general I do tend to find that Google continues to excel in giving accurate, fast and relevant search results. I'd say 70%-plus of my search goes to Google.</p>
<p>As for RSS, I continued to happily use Fever for sometime, but the lack of  choices for quality apps, particularly on iPad and OSX continued to grind. Navigating the web interface on iPad was bearable, but clunky. <a href="/blog/2012/06/15/reeder-for-iphone-supports-fever">Reeder for iPhone</a> was and is an excellent choice, but interestingly Reeder for iPad and OSX has yet to be updated to include Fever support. In the meantime, other apps were released to support Google Reader, but none have Fever support.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/"><img src="http://www.curioustimes.de/assets/appicons/app_icon_mrreader_176.png" align="right"></a>Notably, <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">MrReader</a> became more and more recommended by many power users, and my curiosity grew. In particular, it's support for URL schemes made it compelling. So around New Years, I made the call to switch back. It was nothing to do with the excellent Fever platform, but with the lack of quality front end app support. I may well switch back if app support for Fever takes off. <sup id="fnref-832:a"><a href="#fn-832:a" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The most recent switch back has been to move all my email, contacts and calendar back to my paid Google Apps account. There were three things that gradually became show-stoppers for me with respect to Apple's iCloud:</p>
<ol>
<li>The lack of ability to host your own domain with iCloud. I don't want a me.com or icloud.com email address when I have my own domain. I want my contacts and calendar <em>fully integrated</em> with my email, so they all travelled together.</li>
<li>iCloud calendar sharing outside iCloud is difficult, at best. I want to share calendars with colleagues easily. Google App's systems are generally more open.</li>
<li>Security. I am of the opinion that any online site which I use for storage of personal, sensitive, business-in-confidence or confidential information needs to have more than simple password security. A minimum of 2-factor security is my requirement, especially since the <a href="/blog/2013/03/03/evernotes-password-hack-and-the-security-of-your-stuff-in-the-cloud">security attack on Evernote</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that there are other options for hosting my online world, but with a paid Google Apps account with 2-factor security enabled, I believe this is the best option for me, going forward.</p>
<p>As for my documents, these are for the most part in Dropbox. I have a small number of files in iCloud's <em>Documents in the Cloud</em> service. These are a small number of iWork and specialised documents for which I really appreciate the fast and seamless syncing. But since most of my writing is in plain text using several different apps for iOS, OSX and the web, these best live in Dropbox. I am not considering using Google Drive for these.</p>
<p>Any choice of services utilised is a fine balancing act, considering a range of factors, including security, open-ness and functionality. At this point in time, Google offers the best options in the email, calendar, contacts and RSS <em>for me</em>. I also consider Google the primary option for most search requirements.</p>

<p>Update on 2013-03-14: <a href="/blog/2013/03/14/google-announces-closure-of-reader-service">Google announced the closure of Google Reader</a>, effective 1 July 2013. I will definitely be moving back to Fever between now and then, probably as soon as either Reeder or Mr Reader supports Fever on iPad.&#160;<a href="#fnref-832:a" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
