Sydney&#8217;s Central Railway Station is the main hub for interstate and country trains.

The grand old building is the hub of the station, and makes for some interesting street photography opportunities.

I love the architecture here, and could spend hours exploring the station, the platforms and nearby pedestrian tunnels.

This image was made using my Panasonic GX&#8211;7 and the 20mm f1.7 prime lens - my favourite street photography setup.
