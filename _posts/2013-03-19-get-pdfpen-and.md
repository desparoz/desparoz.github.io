<p><img src="http://smilesoftware.com/assets/images/uploads/PDFpen6_128.png" align="right">One of my must have apps on both iOS and OSX is Smile Software's PDFpen - an elegant, iCloud supported PDF tool that allows you to truly manage PDFs on both platforms. The app allows you to easily create forms, correct and redact text and even sign PDFs on-the-go.</p>
<p><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/pdfpen-6-released-special-upgrade-pricing-for-48-hours">Smile has announced the release of version 6 of both PDFpen and PDFpen Pro for OSX</a> with a bunch of new and improved features, including the ability to turn PDFs into Word documents and many enhancements to the look and feel of the user interface.</p>
<p><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/pdfpen-6-released-special-upgrade-pricing-for-48-hours"><img src="http://d.pr/i/umtP+" width="300" align="left"></a>To gain iCloud support, you must purchase PDFpen or PDFpen Pro through the Mac App Store (MAS). With the lack of upgrade pricing in the MAS, Smile has released both versions today at half the normal price. I'd suggest that all Mac users  take advantage of this offer, which only lasts for 48 hours.</p>
<p>PDFpen is an incredibly important part of my PDF workflow on both OSX and iOS. Having only played with it for a short time, I can honestly say that version 6 of PDFpen Pro for OSX is a major upgrade that will likely bring new possibilities to my workflow.</p>
