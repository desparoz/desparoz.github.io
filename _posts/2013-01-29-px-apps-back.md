<p>After the <a href="/blog/2013/01/23/500px-app-censored">500px app was pulled from the App Store</a> last week, I was glad to see it this morning in my updates list.</p>

<p>Given the few comments from 500px, clearly they have been heads down to get issues resolved to satisfaction. According to GigaOm’s Erica Ogg there were <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/29/500px-back-in-ios-app-store-after-pornography-snafu/">three things required by Apple for 500px to get their apps back in the App Store</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>500px has been updated with three fixes requested by Apple’s app reviewers, including a tweak that will prevent queries for explicit image searches from producing results, adding a function for users to report inappropriate content, and the addition of a 17+ age rating on the app.</p></blockquote>
<p>After my previous post, an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/22/apple-pulls-500pxs-mobile-apps-from-the-app-store-claiming-its-too-easy-to-search-for-nude-photos/">Apple spokesperson made a statement</a> which was reported in TechCrunch and others:</p>
<blockquote><p>The app was removed from the App Store for featuring pornographic images and material, a clear violation of our guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have used 500px for sometime, and although I have seen artistic nudity, I have <em>never</em> seen anything approaching pornography. I wouldn’t want <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">my images</a> associated with any service that knowingly hosted pornography, and would likely drop my membership.</p>
<p>I wonder how long Apple had been talking to 500px prior to pulling the app. On the surface, it <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/smartphone-apps/twitter-apple-criticised-over-porn-videos-20130129-2dhkf.html">appears that double standards may apply</a>, as reported by the SMH:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple allows apps from such big-name social platforms as Twitter, <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/six-seconds-of-pleasure-vines-porn-problem-28266914/">Vine</a>, Tumblr and Pinterest to remain in its App Store even though they contain adult content. Yet it has knocked off other lesser-known sites from its store because of “pornographic images and material”.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe any other company should enforce censorship standards that are over and above those of the western world.</p>
