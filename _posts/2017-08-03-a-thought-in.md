<p><em>A thought in reply to: <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="http://ron.blot.im/microblog-followers">Followers on Microblog - Ron Chester’s Personal Blog</a>...</em></p>Ron Chester lays out an approach to <a href="http://ron.blot.im/microblog-followers">finding people to follow on Micro.blog</a>.

I like Ron's <em>four strategies</em>, although I might call them four stages of evolution as I went through a very similar process—and still do. Strategies 2 and 4 are the ones that I find most rewarding.

The concluding paragraphs of Ron's post, however, have some real gold. In particular:

<blockquote>
  There are no visible scores on Microblog. This is a very good thing. It means I can just concentrate on posting things others might find interesting and then being interested in things I might find posted by others. There’s no way to tell who’s popular, nor a way to game a system to look more popular. I hope that doesn’t change.
</blockquote>

I hope that others might see this post, and choose to <a href="http://micro.blog/ron">follow Ron on Micro.blog</a>, or maybe to subscribe to <a href="http://blot.im/ron">Ron's new blog on Blot.im</a>.

If you're a <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> user looking for people to follow, take a look at Ron's post, and perhaps also take a look at <a href="https://colinwalker.blog/directory/">Colin Walker's Webmentions directory</a>, or perhaps <a href="http://desparoz.com/directory">my webmention directory</a>.
