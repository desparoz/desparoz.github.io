A return to Australia

My posting has been a little light on here over the past few months, but I have a good excuse â€” I&#8217;ve been deployed as part of my Navy duties for five months on a journey that has taken us to some ten nations on three continents (not including Australia).

I am a Public Affairs Officer (PAO) in the <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au">Royal Australian Navy</a>, and since late last year I have been the embarked PAO in the helicopter frigate <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-anzac-iii">HMAS <em>Anzac</em></a> for NORTHERN TRIDENT 2015 (NT15).

NT15 had several key aspects - commemoration of the <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/Events/CentenaryOfAnzac/">Centenary of Anzac</a>, international engagement and interoperability with international navies.

It was a very busy and successful deployment, and was one which allowed us to visit some amazing places, including Greece, Turkey, Italy, Malta, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Morocco, South Africa and Mauritius. I personally really loved Malta in particular, with Mauritius, the UK, Crete and Cape Town being great visits also.

The above video, shot by our embarked Imagery Specialist, supported by colleagues ashore and compiled by Defence Multimedia, tells a short story of our return to Sydney last Saturday (8 August 2015).

Now that I am back, I look forward to getting back into posting my personal photos, and posting about photography and diving.
