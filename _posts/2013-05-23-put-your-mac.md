<p>As a trainer and presenter, I often set my Macbook Air up in classrooms and conference venues. When I go to lunch or another break, I often wonder whether I remembered to lock my Macbook Air.</p>

<p>This post today from <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/5/put-your-mac-to-sleep-with-ios-drafts">MacSparky</a> (@MacSparky on <a href="http://alpha.app.net/macsparky">App.net</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/macsparky">Twitter</a>) provides a wonderful little automation that uses <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> on iOS, Dropbox and <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> on the Macbook Air. </p>

<p>So I can now be sitting at lunch, and type a command into Drafts, and as long as my Macbook is online, it will go to sleep a few seconds later.</p>

<p>A great automation tip from MacSparky!</p>
