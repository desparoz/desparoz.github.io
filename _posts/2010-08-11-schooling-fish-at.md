<p>Luaudi (Dinahs Beach) is the dive site in PNG's Milne Bay where the term muck diving was coined.</p>
<p> I went there setup for macro with a 60mm lens, and was really pleased with the small stuff. Incredible variety of wierd and wonderful things I haven't seen anywhere else.</p>
<p> I was also impressed with the schooling fish in the shallows, and how close they let you get. This image was made right underneath our diveboat in perhaps 2-3m of water.</p>
