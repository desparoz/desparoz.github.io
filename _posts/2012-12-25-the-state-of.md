<p>According to the SMH, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/-2bv55.html">too few AustralianÂ university entrants are considering science</a> for their degrees.
<blockquote>As the next generation of Australia's workforce use their smartphones and tablets and chat over social networks, this trend of declining interest in science and technology suggests the uncomfortable question: are we going to be a nation of creators of the future, or just the consumers of it?</p></blockquote>
<p>When I entered uni, I never really considered science. If I had my time again, I would study science in a heartbeat.</p>
