<p>These are my Around the Web links for July 4th through August 20th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theletterapp.com/">Let.ter</a> - Just picked up the Let.ter app after a this reminder from @MacSparky &mdash; I had previously read about it, but was pleased to see it released.

Let.ter is a minimalist email sending (only) app for OSX that is built on Markdown.

Loving it</li>
<li><a href="http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2014/08/keanu-reeves-john-rain-television-series.html">Keanu Reeves John Rain Television Series</a> - I enjoy Barry Eisler&#039;s series of thrillers based on the character John Rain, and look forward to a potential TV series with Keanue Reeves in  the lead role</li>
<li><a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2014/7/little-snitch-to-keep-lte-costs-down">Little Snitch to Keep LTE Costs Down</a> - A worthwhile reason for looking into the use of Little Snitch</li>
<li><a href="http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/unread-s-earnings">A Candid Look at Unread&rsquo;s First Year</a> - The upfront pricing model is a scary proposition for devs, especially if a &#039;successful&#039; app like Unread only generates a moderate income in its first year. Where is the incentive to keep developing. This is a concern not just for devs but also for users who won&#039;t get updated apps if the money isn&#039;t there for the devs.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/07/28/app-rot">App Rot</a> - A compelling take on the viability of the App Store model to sustain development, especially given the up front pricing model. Worth a read.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK-g-4qdFmY">Trey Ratcliff &amp; his GoPro Quadcopter - DigiDIRECT TV Ep 078</a> - Blunty of DigiDirect TV presents a video of Trey Ratcliff showing off his Phantom Quadrocopter at the recent Game of Thrones photo walk I attended in Sydney. Good fun.</li>
