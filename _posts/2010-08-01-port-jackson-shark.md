<p>This image was made at Oak Park, near Cronulla in Sydney's south. It features a shark that is common in Sydney waters, the Port Jackson shark.</p>
<p> Often these guys are at least partly under rocks, so seeing it out in the open I took a wide berth around him to come from in front. Starting about 5m away, I started flashing my strobe to get him used to the light flashing, before getting nice and tight for this shot.</p>
