<p>Its been waaayyyy too long since I posted a Photo of the Day, but will intend to get that going regularly again.</p>
<p>These two Chromodoris kuniei were spotted on a dive in 2006 in PNG's Milne Bay area.</p>
<p>The nudibranch on the right is facing us, while the one on the left is facing away. This "69" position is how nudibranchs typically mate.</p>
<p>C. kuniei is one of the more vividly coloured nudibranchs, with the beautiful purples of the mantle edge and spots contrasting the golden brown.</p>
