My friends <a href="http://oceanguardians.com.au/about-us/">Cherie and Jim Dodd</a> have setup a Pozible project to launch the <a href="http://pozible.com/oceanguardians"><em>Ocean Guardians - Magazine &amp; Directory</em></a>.</p>
<p>Jim and Cherie are two of the most passionate divers I know, and dive incredibly regularly around Nelson Bay. They are both very <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimdodduwphotography/">talented photographers</a>, and are enthusiastic about protecting the oceans and building awareness of the life in it.</p>
<p>Cherie describes their vision for the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the years I have been gathering information about organizations, businesses, groups and individuals from around the world who are influential in the survival of our Oceans. While doing this I have met, both in person and virtually (thanks to the internet), some amazing people.</p>
<p>My plan is to take this growing collection of names and information to create the Ocean Guardians Directory and to share their inspirational stories though the Ocean Guardians Magazine …</p></blockquote>
<p>As a Pozible project, the funding to get the project going comes from crowdsourcing - getting interested parties to commit to a contribution. The contribution is deducted from you only when the project reaches its stated goal to get off the ground.</p>
<p>I have pledged to <a href="http://pozible.com/oceanguardians">support this project</a>, and strongly encourage all divers and those with a passion for the marine environment to do so too!</p>
<p>BTW, Jim undertook a <a href="http://www.divingidc.com/idc/">PADI Instructor Development Course</a> with me at <a href="http://letsgoadventures.com.au">Let’s Go Adventures</a> last year.</p>
