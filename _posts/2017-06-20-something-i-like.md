<p><em>Something I like: <a class="u-like-of" href="http://www.manton.org/2017/06/what-to-post-to-a-microblog.html">What to post to a microblog | Manton Reece</a>...</em></p>Manton Reece discusses some of the key uses for micro.blog (the service).

I post my micro thoughts (like this one) to my main Wordpress blog, and use my hosted <a href="http://micro.blog/desparoz">micro.blog feed</a> for at least three of the use cases Manton has suggested:

<ol>
<li>As a Twitstitute (aka Twitter substitute).</li>
<li>As a link blog.</li>
<li>As a photoblog.</li>
</ol>

These are all good uses, and serve to reduce clutter on my main website while maintaining my ownership of my content.
