<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on <a href="http://mylio.com">Mylio</a> for some time, considering at as possible future replacement for Aperture. </p>

<p>Until now Mylio has been North America only for its paid subscriptions, but today the <a href="http://mylio.com/2014/12/mylio-now-available-worldwide/">international release of Mylio has been announced</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. English version of Mylio is now available to download and purchase in the locations listed&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Australia is one of those locations, along with many other countries.</p>
