<p>This colourful wrasse was swimming in a fairly consisten pattern around me as I was taking macro photos, so I noted the point at which it would come above me with a blue water background, and took a shot each time it came past that point.</p>
<p> Made in November 2005 during a photographer trip aboard the MV Esperance Star, a liveaboard then operating out of Brisbane's Morton Bay.</p>
