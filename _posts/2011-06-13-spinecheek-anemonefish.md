<p>The spinecheek anemone fish is one of several anemone fish found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters.</p>
<p>This one is so named due to the spiney growth protruding from the side of the fish's face that you can see quite clearly in the photo, just under the eye and extending over the flourescent white band.</p>
<p>These are quite a pretty anemone fish, founding living in a symbiotic relationship with its host anemone.</p>
<p>This image was made on a dive In Milne Bay, PNG, where we were diving from the Tawali Resort. I used a 60mm macro lens and two strobes to provide even lighting.</p>
