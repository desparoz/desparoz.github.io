<p style="text-align: left;">Its beenÂ <em>way</em> to long since I last published a <a href="http://djp.me/potd">Photo of the Day</a>. I am going to try to get back on the wagon, and get some regular images up here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I made this image at Sunset on New Years Eve, capturing the beautiful sunset across Clovelly Bay, with the surf club in the background.</p>
<p>This is of course an HDR image, with three exposure mapped together to get the result I was looking for!</p>
