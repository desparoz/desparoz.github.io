<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/y5K3+"width="300" align="right">Back in January I <a href="http://www.desparoz.me/2013/01/07/nsw-bushfires-and-the-fires-near-me-nsw-app/">posted</a> about the Rural Fire Services of NSW&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/fires-near-me-nsw/id370891827?mt=8">Fires Near Me</a> app on what was a record temperature day in NSW, with a declared <em>catastrophic fire danger</em>. Fortunately the danger passed mostly smoothly. </p>

<p>Ten months later we are in the midst of a declared State of Emergency in NSW and that old post is still getting a lot of hits. I am pleased it might be helping to get the word out. </p>

<p>I just cruised by the App Store app and was pleased to see that Apple is giving the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/fires-near-me-nsw/id370891827?mt=8">Fires Near Me</a> app top left billing in the above the fold featured area for <em>Best New Apps</em>. Fires Near Me is not technically a <em>new</em> app, but it is great that people can find it quickly, on a day that has the very real potential for disastrous fire damage. </p>

<p>This is a small but important gesture by Apple, one that supports the incredible efforts of the fire fighters, police, emergency services personnel and the variety of government, private sector and volunteer organisations supporting their efforts. </p>

<p>Best wishes for a safe day for all those effected. Use the app, along with news services and social media to keep teack, and heed warnings. If recommended, leave early. </p>
