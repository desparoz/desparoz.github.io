<p>Accessory lens maker <a href="http://www.43rumors.com/lensbaby-announces-the-circular-fisheye-5-8mm-f3-5-for-mft/">LensBaby has announced a circular 5.8mm for micro 4/3 cameras, among others</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Circular Fisheye is great for capturing the scale of endless landscapes and big events, fun self-portraits, quirky shots of pets or friends, creating extreme perspective, and experimenting with unique lens flare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am gradually moving over to m43 type cameras, and a good Fisheye is in planned list of future lens aquisitions.</p>

<p>This lens could certainly have good applications for underwater work, so I am going to look further into this as a contender.</p>
