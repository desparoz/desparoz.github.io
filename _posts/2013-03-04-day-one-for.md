The iOS version this week received a major update, going to version 1.10, where the ability to export entries (single or a range) to a PDF file was introduced.</p>
<p>This is a terrific enhancement that allows the user to extract key data, perhaps sorted by <em>tag</em> (introduced last year to the iOS version) to a standalone PDF document, or perhaps to a PDF document that might then be stored in a system such as Evernote or DEVONthink.</p>
<p>Other updates include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Custom date range- Tag filtering</li>
<li>Send PDF to iBooks, Dropbox and other apps</li>
<li>Export will run in background</li>
<li>Quick single entry export via Send menu</li>
<li>Historical weather increased from 3 days to 30 days</li>
<li>New reminder sound</li>
<li>Added Sanchez font option</li>
<li>Improved header and HTML styling</li>
</ul>
