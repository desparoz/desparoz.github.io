<p>USS Bonhomme Richard at Garden Island</p>

<p>In August 2013 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bonhomme_Richard_(LHD-6)">USS <em>Bonhomme Richard</em></a> (LHD 06) paid a visit to Sydney&#8217;s Fleet Base East. </p>

<p><em>Bonhomme Richard</em> is a Landing Helicopter Dock (aka Ambhibious Assault Ship) that is capable of carrying helicopters, STOVL fighters and a large force of embarked marines that can be landed by helicopter or landing craft launched from the LHD&#8217;s well deck.</p>

<p><em>Bonhomme Richard</em> is of a similar size and role as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_class_landing_helicopter_dock">Canberra class LHDs</a> shortly to be commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy.</p>

<p>Being a large ship, the challenge was to find a suitable location publicly accessible from which to get the whole ship into frame, without too much in the way of foreground distractions.</p>

<p>Being a beautiful Sydney day, the sky and the harbour were both quite blue, so the blue-grey colour of <em>Bonhomme Richard</em> also caused a challenge for contrast.</p>

<p>The old structure in the foreground became a good solution to both problemsâ€”it provided colour and depth, without being too distracting. The challenge was to frame it appropriately.</p>
