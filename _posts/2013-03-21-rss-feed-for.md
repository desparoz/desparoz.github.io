<p>With the move by Google to discontinue Google Reader (the "GReadier Debacle"), I am moving any mission critical, non-paid services away from Google.</p>
<p>As part of that, the Feedburner feed for this site is no longer going to be the default feed, and at some point it is likely to be discontinued.</p>
<p>Although it will continue to operate for existing users until that time, can I suggest you unsubscribe and resubscribe to the RSS feed for Des Paroz On-The-Go, which is at <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7de4b0868e8c0e3dc3/1364537213823/#img">www.desparoz.com/feed/</a>.</p>
