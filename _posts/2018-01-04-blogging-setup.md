Like a lot of people here, the new year brings an opportunity to reevaluate my blogging and social setup.

I've decided to make my micro.blog account my main personal blog for thoughts, links, etc.

My [BalancedLight](http://desparoz.com) blog is going to be focused on photography and exploration.

I've taken the step of disabling automatic cross-posting to micro.blog from BalancedLight, at least for now. My intention is to adopt _mindful cross-posting_, so I will make this a manual step for posts that warrant a cross post.

I will continue cross-posting from micro.blog to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/desparoz), and micro.blog will continue to be the origin of (essentially) all of my posting to Twitter.

I am not planning to give on Twitter â€“ _yet_. But I will post here on micro.blog, and consume content and reply over there. I'd like to see that phase out as more and more adopters move over to micro.blog.

That's where my thinking is for now. I am sure it will continue to evolve.
