<p>According to an opinion piece in the SMH by Prof Hugh White, <a href="/blog/opinion/politics/caught-in-a-bind-that-threatens-an-asian-war-nobody-wants-20121225-2bv38.html">war between China and an allied Japan and USA is an increasing possibility</a>.
<blockquote>The Greek historian Thucydides first explained the difference almost 2500 years ago. He wrote that the catastrophic Peloponnesian War started from a spat between Athens and one of Sparta's allies over a relatively insignificant dispute. But what caused the war was something much graver: the growing wealth and power of Athens, and the fear this caused in Sparta.</p></blockquote>
<p>I of course find the prospect of a war so close-to-home unnerving, but this is an interesting analysis of a series of seemingly small events that could escalate.</p>
<p>I recall when I was living in Japan in the early 90's that there was press and worry about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute">Kuril Islands Dispute</a> between Russia and Japan (both claim sovereignty). Fortunately that situation <del>seemed to be resolved peacefully</del> (although unresolved at this writing) seems to be being negotiated diplomatically and has not resulted in military conflict.</p>
