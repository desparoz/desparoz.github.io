<p>Coogee Beach Sunrise 19 July 2010.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful winters morning in Sydney. Quite cool, and I was impressed with the number of swimmers who came and had a dip in this ocean pool at Coogee. Hardy souls indeed!</p>
<p> This is an HDR image. Three images (0, +2 EV and -2 EV) were made consecutively. From Aperture I used the Photomatix plugin to merge and tonemap the resulting image you see here.</p>
<p> This process allowed me to capture the full range of tones I saw in the morning - more than my camera could "see" in any single exposure.</p>
