<p> According to MacRumours.com, Apple's <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/09/apple-shutting-down-iwork-com-amid-transition-to-icloud/" target="_self" title="">iWork.com services is being canned</a> from 31st July 2012.</p>

<p> I am sure this is hardly a surprise to anyone, given that it has been a little underwhelming. I'm a pretty hardcore Apple / iWork / iCloud user, and I never really got what iWork.com's use case would be, at least for me. I have used it once or twice, mainly for quick sharing of an iWork document from iPad, but that would be it.</p>
<p> I think iWork.com functionality is still needed for collaboration. Even if its not been heavily used at this time, such functionality has to be part of Apple's long term plan for iCloud and iWork.</p>
<p>The timing of this is interesting. 31st July is "late (northern hemisphere) Summer 2012", the timing Apple has specified for the full launch of OSX Mountain Lion. <strong>I somehow expect that there will be new functionality baked into OSX Mountain Lion and iCloud that will easily allow document collaboration</strong> between users.</p>
<p>As I've stated in the last few posts, iWork on OSX desparately needs iCloud's <em>Documents in the Cloud</em> feature enabled. Until then iCloud is going to be clunky compared to DropBox for desktop users, though it does have the advantage for users that are predominately iOS based. For users that switch back and forth (like me, and most others I reckon), either solution is clunky.</p>
<p>I hope that Documents in the Cloud for OSX will be opened up soon - much sooner than 31st July. It certainly needs to be before MS Office is released on iOS.</p>
<p>But, I look forward to the concept of document collaboration between users being baked into iWork and iCloud, from OSX or iOS.</p>
