<p><em>A thought in reply to: <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="http://boffosocko.com/2017/06/30/blogroll-improvements/">Blogrolls are coming back</a>...</em></p>I'm really enjoying the <em>back-to-the</em> future nature of IndieWeb blogging, and am intrigued to see the return of the blogroll.

Maintaining the blogroll is likely to be the challlenge for many, as there are many moving parts of a blog.

I love that your approach focuses on IndieWeb blogsâ€¦
