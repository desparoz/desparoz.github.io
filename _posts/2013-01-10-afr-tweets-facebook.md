<p><img height="300" alt="IMG_1135" width="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-426" src="http://www.desparoz.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_1135.png" />The Australian Financial Review has a good article describing the <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/tweets_facebook_posts_track_fire_1w02pIg92vyK71tGg7GtjP">role played by social media in getting the word out about fire warnings</a> during the potentially catastrophic confluence of weather we had on Tuesday.
As discussed in my post on the the <a href="/blog/2013/01/07/nsw-bushfires-and-the-fires-near-me-nsw-app">NSW Bushfires and the Fires Near Me app</a>, agencies like the <a href="http://twitter.com/nswrfs">NSW Rural Fire Service</a> and the <a href="http://twitter.com/nswpolice">NSW Police</a>, backed up by media like the <a href="http://twitter.com/ABCEmergency">ABC</a> have used Twitter very effectively to get the word out. The RFS' Fires Near Me NSW app served this purpose well, as did their website and the bulk SMS sent out to people in the areas declared to have a catastrophic fire risk.</p>
<p>So far, this situation has been dealt with very effectively by the agencies concerned, and I hope people will continue to use the tools and heed the warnings passed on.</p>
