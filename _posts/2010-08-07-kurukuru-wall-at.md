<p>Kurukuru is one of the amazing wall dives at Uepi. With the wall dropping from the surface to over 2000m, it is covered in fantastic corals, such as the picturesque sea whips.</p>
<p> The blue waters are generally very, very clear, and as can be seen, are full of small anf medium fish. Large fish such as sharks, mantas, bump headed wrasse and more are regularly seen. We were told that orcas and dolphins are also seen from time to time, but sadly, we didn't get to enjoy that experience. Maybe next time.</p>
