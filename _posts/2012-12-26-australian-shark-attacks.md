<p>Its summer, the news is a little light on, so the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/wa-news/wa-continues-fight-against-shark-attacks-20121217-2bika.html">media begins to focus on shark attacks</a>:
<blockquote>Some may have considered the three fatal shark attacks in West Australian waters in 2011 to be a tragic coincidence.</p>
<p>However, when a further <a href="http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/timeline-of-shark-attacks-on-wa-beaches-20081227-75sl.html">two fatal attacks </a>and one <a href="http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/fight-or-flight-i-chose-fight-shark-survivor-20121210-2b5rt.html">life threatening shark attack</a> occurred in the state in 2012, many had little doubt WA had a shark problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, the article talks a lot about the positive research that is being done to deter sharks, but nonetheless it is a predictable story in the media in the Australian summer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to suggest for a second that shark attacks are anything but horrific for those involved, but they should also be put in context. The Australian Shark Attack File, Taronga Zoo shows that <a href="http://taronga.org.au/animals-conservation/conservation-science/australian-shark-attack-file/latest-figures">in the 222 years since 1791 there have been 201 fatal, unprovoked shark attacks in Australia</a>. Thats less than 1 per year!</p>
<p>Compare that to the 121 people who drown at the beach year in Australia. Or the following <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/1676C30C00F8776CCA2579C6000F7064?opendocument">accidental causes of death in Australia in 2010</a> (Australian Bureau of Statistics):</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 16px;">Transport accident: 1502</span></li>
<li>Accidental falls: 1648</li>
<li>Assault: 217</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these accidental causes of death are quite low in the <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/03/the-most-common-causes-of-death-in-australia/">top 20 causes of death in Australia in 2010</a> - a list which is dominated by cardio vascular disease and cancer.</p>
