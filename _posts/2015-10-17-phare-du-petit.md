One of the landmarks clearly seen on entering the magnificent port of Brest in France is the lighthouse known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phare_du_Petit_Minou">Phare du Petit Minou</a>.

For mariners of today and days past, lighthouses guide the way to safety around hidden dangers. A lighthouse seen from an appropriate distance can provide comfort, but a lighthouse seen from up close, too late, can bring sheer terror.

The symbolism of lighthouses cuts across many parts of life. There are few paths which have not been trodden by others before us, and in many cases those people left clues about dangers on the path, and routes of best passage. The clues are there for us, and by paying attention we can avoid dangers that others have faced.

This image was created at sunset, which was very late in the evening - around 10:30pm. The image was shot at f/16 with a shutter speed of 2 seconds on ISO 200. Obviously a tripod was the critical piece of equipment to ensure a good, sharp image.

My equipment for this image was my Panasonic Lumix GX&#8211;7 with the Olympus 12&#8211;40mm f/2.8 PRO lens and my trusty <a href="http://www.reallyrightstuff.com/Shop/Carbon-Fiber-Tripods/TVC-23-Versa-series-2-3-sections-leg.html">Really Right Stuff</a> tripod.
