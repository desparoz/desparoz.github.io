<p>When it comes to science, individuals may be entitled to have their own ideas, but they are <a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The+Weekend+Conversation&amp;utm_content=The+Weekend+Conversation+CID_3c0d48f2ec9dd5a5c9c9c86736d02446" target="_blank">not entitled to push their opinions without clear, peer reviewed evidence</a>.
