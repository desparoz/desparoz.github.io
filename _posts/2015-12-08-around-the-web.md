Around the Web for 08 December 2015

<a href="http://www.fantasticmaps.com/2015/12/an-illustrators-review-of-the-ipad-pro-and-apple-pencil/">An Illustrator's Review of the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil</a>

<blockquote>
  But to my mind, the iPad Pro deserves the Professional label – this is a serious piece of hardware for illustrators, and it’s been a long time coming. And if you buy it, buy the Pencil. Without it you’re not doing the iPad Pro justice.

<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/apple-maps-once-a-laughingstock-now-dominates-iphones-20151207-glhwa2">Apple Maps, once a laughing stock, now dominates iPhones</a>

<blockquote>
  Apple fixed errors as users submitted them. It quietly bought several mapping companies, mostly for their engineers and other talent. Recently, it added transit directions for several major cities, narrowing a major gap with Google. Apple Maps is now used more widely than Google Maps on iPhones.

And MacSparky weighs in...

<blockquote>
  The news about Apple Maps being used three times more than its “leading competitor” is being touted as a victory from Apple. I see it differently. In my mind, the built in maps app should be used ten times as much as anything else.

My favourite task management app keeps innovating...

<blockquote>
  Today we’ve released updates for both Mac and iOS that bring Push-Triggered Sync to every copy of OmniFocus.

I applaud DropBox for vein willing to try, and being willing to take a different tack

<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2015/12/saying-goodbye-to-carousel-and-mailbox/">Saying goodbye to Carousel and Mailbox | | Dropbox Blog</a>

<blockquote>
  Building new products is about learning as much as it’s about making. It’s also about tough choices. Over the past few months, we’ve increased our team’s focus on collaboration and simplifying the way people work together. In light of that, we’ve made the difficult decision to shut down Carousel and Mailbox.

<blockquote>
  You don’t need a certain number of followers, a “passive income,” a “monetization strategy” or “1000 true fans” to justify sharing your work.
  
  All you need is 1.
