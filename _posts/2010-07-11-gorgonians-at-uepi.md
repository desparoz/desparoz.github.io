<p>This image was made at a magical dive site called Uepi Point. Literally 2 minutes from the pier at Uepi Island, this site is at a point where a channel between Uepi and the adjacent island meets "The Slot" - a 3000m drop off into the open ocean.</p>
<p> At this site there is a point at 30m where you sit on the edge of the wall, and where you regularly see pelagic creatures coming up from the deep.</p>
<p> I find that every dive destination has some feature that captures me as the outstanding thing of the location. </p>
<p> For Uepi Island diving in general, and sites like Uepi Point in particular it was definitely the abundance and size of gorgonians.</p>
