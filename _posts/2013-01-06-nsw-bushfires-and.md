<p>Tomorrow is going to be a <strong>very</strong> hot day in NSW, with <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/catastrophic-conditions-bushfire-danger-as-mercury-to-hit-45-degrees-20130107-2cbto.html">temperatures of 43C predicted right across the Sydney metro area</a>. Coupled with predictions of extremely strong winds (60-80kph), government officials are warning of catastrophic bushfire conditions, particularly in areas like the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and Southern Highlands.

<p>Apparently this combination of hot weather and winds are leading to the NSW Rural Fire Service predicting a high potential for severe, extreme and or even catastrophic bushfires across the state. The <a href="https://twitter.com/rfsmedia/status/288111473341919233">following tweet from the RFS</a> shows the current thnking:</p>
<blockquote><p>Statewide Total Fire Ban declared for tomorrow. Catastrophic Fire Danger forecast for Illawarra/Shoalhaven and Southern Ranges.</p></blockquote>
<p>First things first, every person who lives in or near a bushfire-prone area in NSW should</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a <a href="http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/file_system/attachments/Attachment_BushFireSurvivalPlan.pdf">bushfire survival plan</a>; and</li>
<li>Act on that plan early (and don't wait to leave the area)</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone in such an area should closely monitor reports of fire outbreaks. In 2013 there are some good new options for this, complementing tried and tested methods like local radio and television broadcasts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/nswrfs">Rural Fire Service</a> on Twitter</li>
<li>Download the RFS' iOS app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/fires-near-me-nsw/id370891827?mt=8">Fires Near Me NSW</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This new app is terrific. It geolocates you (if you allow the app to use your location), and then plots up-to-date information from the RFS about fires that might be in your area, and their status, along with any other information.</p>
<p>In the words of the <a href="http://twitter.com/robrfs">RFS Deputy Commission of Operations, Bob Rogers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/robrfs/status/288113895468564480">People should not underestimate how deadly tomorrow's fire danger could be. #nswfires</a></p></blockquote>
