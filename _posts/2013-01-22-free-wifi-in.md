I spend quite a lot of time in Wollongong, working with <a href="http://untethered.com.au">Untethered</a> and teaching <a href="http://www.divingidc.com/idc/">PADI Instructor Courses</a> and other dive courses at <a href="http://www.uniteddivers.com.au">United Divers</a>. Its a beautiful city, close to Sydney on the NSW south coast, with wonderful scenery and great infrastructure, without all of the hustle and bustle of the capital city.</p>
<p>Wollonong City has been quite progressive in making itself technologically significant, and I was interested to read in Lifehacker that <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/01/wollongong-cbd-adds-free-wi-fi/">Wollongong CBD now has free Wi-Fi </a>, provided by the Wollonogong City Council.</p>
<p>According to the Council’s <a href="http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/council/news/Pages/connectwithcitycentrewifi.aspx">press release</a>, from 21 January 2013:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wollongong City Wi-Fi is available in outdoor areas on Crown Street between Keira and Corrimal Streets, as well as in Globe Lane, and the Arts Precinct (formerly Civic Plaza) on Burelli Street. The free Wi-Fi service will also be extended west along Crown Street to Gladstone Avenue in coming weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its great to see free wifi role out in various towns and cities around Australia. Next time I go down to “the Gong” I will give the free wifi a try, and see how the speed and connectivity is.</p>
