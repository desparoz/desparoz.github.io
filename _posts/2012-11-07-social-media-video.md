<p>I've been a fan of Eric Qualman's (T: <a href="http://twitter.com/equalman">@equalman</a>) writings and videos on social media for several years now, and am happy to see his <a href="http://www.socialnomics.net/2012/11/07/social-media-video-2013/" target="_blank">Social Media 2013 Video</a>.
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QUCfFcchw1w" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I love some of the quotes/stats from the video, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 5 couples meet online; 3 in 5 gay couples meet online</li>
<li>Every minute 72 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like Eric's stuff, consider buying his bookÂ <em><a href="http://amzn.to/S0kN0c" target="_blank">Socialnomics</a></em>.</p>
<p>As an aside, I find it interesting that Eric is not yet on <a href="http://alpha.app.net" target="_blank">App.Net</a>. It shows perhaps that ADN is still largely a geek thing, but it will be interesting to watch its trajectory...</p>
