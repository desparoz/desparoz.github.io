<p>Following the brilliant <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2847">SMBC comic on automatic email signatures</a>, <a href="http://donmelton.com/2013/01/06/automatic-email-signatures-are-the-worst-thing-in-history/">Don Melton</a> wrote:
<blockquote>...including irrelevant crap in your signature is neither witty nor useful</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2847"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/0480c9fad6.jpg" width="367" height="390" /></a>I dislike boilerplate email signatures, although I do leave the "Sent from my iPhone" (or iPad) signature on to let people know that there's a reason the email is brief.</p>
<p>When I compose an email that requires a signature block, the reason for the signature block will vary depending on the context. As I have a variety of roles, I have different signature blocks for each role.</p>
<p>What I do is have a <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> snippet (on Mac OSX or iOS) for each of those contextual roles, and then insert those manually into my email when required. And if its not required, I leave it out. When I used Windows, I would typically use <a href="http://www.activewords.com">ActiveWords</a> to do the same thing (and more).</p>
<p>Communications (including email) should be mindful, not mindless. Put thought into all elements of your email, including the signature block.</p>
