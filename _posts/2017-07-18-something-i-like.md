<p><em>Something I like: <a class="u-like-of" href="https://colinwalker.blog/2017/07/18/the-doctor-debate/">The Doctor debate</a>...</em></p>A really thoughtful post by @colinwalker on the actor to play the next generation lead in the Doctor Who series.

I think that there is a real possibility that the new lead will bring a whole new dimension to a character that is defined as one that re-generates from time-to-time. The ability to bring feminine attributes to this character should present interesting opportunities for the character's ongoing development.

I hope that the actor is judged by the performance and ability to bring life to the character, and not by gender.
