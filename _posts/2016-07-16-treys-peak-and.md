There have been a couple of pretty interesting photography related things happening in the last week.

<h2>Trey&#8217;s Peak</h2>

Earlier this week photographer <a href="http://stuckincustoms.com">Trey Ratcliff</a> and photography accessory designer <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com">Peak Designs</a> launched a <a href="http://pkdsn.com/trey">kickstarter campaign for <strong>four</strong> new photography bag designs</a> - two backpacks, a &#8216;tote&#8217; bag and a sling bag.

Their goal was to achieve $500,000 to get the Kickstarter campaign off the ground, and the campaign is set to run for 60 days.

This is Peak Design&#8217;s sixth Kickstarter (and their second with Trey Ratcliff), and they smashed the records <strong>with over $1 million in committed backers in under 24 hours</strong>.

Peak Designs have developed a range of wonderful photo accessories, and have basically funded product development through Kickstarters. I believe they have never taken external investors. They are a massive example of how crowd funding can provide a different funding model.

But the lesson is that it&#8217;s not easy or automatic. Peak Designs have set about building quality products for photographers, and have gained customer loyalty by delivering a great <em>customer experience</em> through those products. Along the way they have gained the attention and partnership of key photographic mavens like Trey who bring their audience together with Peak&#8217;s.

An overnight sensation, five plus years in the making.

<h2>Lightroom Mobile (iOS) gets RAW</h2>

I am pretty excited about this. The iPad Pro is my tool of choice for on the go computing (and has been for <a href="http://dip.me/ides">years</a>, but making it work with my photo workflow has been a big gap.

That&#8217;s changing with Adobe announcing that <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/lightroomjournal/2016/07/lightroom-mobile-july-updates.html">Version 2.4 of Lightroom Mobile supports RAW</a>, along with other enhancements such as local adjustment tools.

Location independent photographer <a href="http://elialocardi.com">Elia Locardi</a> was part of the beta testing of <a href="http://www.blamethemonkey.com/adobe-announces-raw-photo-editing-in-lightroom-mobile-for-ios">Lightroom Mobile version 2.4</a>.

<blockquote>
When I was asked to test out the new Adobe Lightroom Mobile for iOS–to see how it would hold up to my on-the-road raw processing workflow–I decided there was only one logical thing to be done to ensure success. Take the project to Greece! 
</blockquote>

Elia&#8217;s experience seems to back up the idea that this is the start of something interesting in the iOS RAW photo workflow space.

<blockquote>
While Adobe Lightroom Mobile doesn’t contain all of the editing features of Lightroom Desktop yet, all of the most important editing features are present.

Be sure to take a look at Elia&#8217;s post where he discusses those <a href="http://www.blamethemonkey.com/adobe-announces-raw-photo-editing-in-lightroom-mobile-for-ios">important editing features </a>. Also, take a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/NknKUrGLkP4">Lightroom Mobile for iOS</a> video he produced on location in Greece.
