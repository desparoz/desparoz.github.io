<p>I plan to blog a bit more in detail later, and post some images, but Belinda and I visited the <a href="/blog/Ranhc">Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre</a> yesterday.
It was a beautiful summer-time Sunday in Sydney, and we were perhaps two of less than 10 visitors at the centre for the entire time we were there.</p>
<p>Getting there involves a short ferry ride from Circular Quay to Garden Island. There is no land access (except for tourist buses).</p>
<p>It's truly one of Sydney's hidden gems, with magnificent vistas for photographers.</p>
