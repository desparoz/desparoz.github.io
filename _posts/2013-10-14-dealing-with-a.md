<p>One of the basics of customer service is (or at least <em>should be</em>) honesty. If a problem occurs in a customer service scenario three simple rules should be followed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Admit the problem.</li>
<li>Find the root cause and fix the problem.</li>
<li>Move on.</li>
</ol>

<p>While this should be fundamental to all customer service situations, all too often something gets in the way. Whether it be a fear of liability or simple ego too many service providers fail to own up to a problem when it occurs.</p>

<p>Author of the fabulous <a href="https://members.nerdgap.com/order-evernote-essentials/"><em>Evernote Essentials</em></a> ebook, Brett Kelly, had a <a href="http://nerdgap.com/customer-service-mistake/">customer service disaster</a> and quickly identified a problem that resulted in a lot of customers (and non-customers) getting incorrect emails indicating a purchase had been processed. Brett quickly fixed the problem and has today posted on his blog about it.</p>

<p>Brett goes into detail about the cause of the problem (spoiler alert: human error) and its effect. He offers an apology, and then learns from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moral of the story is summarized nicely by a proverb I’m going to get tattooed across my frickin’ forehead later today: <strong>Measure twice, cut once.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good example of a customer service problem being turned around. I suspect he might even gain sales from his honest approach.</p>
