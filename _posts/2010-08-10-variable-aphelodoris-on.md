<p>Last weekend Bela and I had an easy dive at Clifton Gardens, in Mosman, Sydney. This shallow, inner harbour site features a wide array of small marine life - octopus, cuttlefish, juvenile fish and nudibranchs.</p>
<p> In particular, there were plenty of the species Aphelodoris varia. They were present in large numbers, and were some of the biggest of these species I've seen anywhere. They must be well fed at Clifton Gardens.</p>
<p> I liked these two A. varia that were on a converging path on sand. Moving at snails pace (sorry for the pun), I don't think there would've been much damage in this collision.</p>
