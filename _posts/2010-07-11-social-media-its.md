<p>Our new Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has started tweeting (<a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaGillard">@JuliaGillard</a>), following on from our ex-PM Kevin Rudd (<a href="http://twitter.com/KevinRuddMP">@KevinRuddMP</a>). Where Kevin07 seems to speak for himself, dropping anecdotes and one liners, Ms Gillard's tweets are clearly from a staffer. Consider these examples (the last three as of this writing):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaGillard/status/18317219779">The PM is giving a speech in Adelaide this morning.  Listen here - [bit.ly/watchABCn...](http://bit.ly/watchABCnow)﻿</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaGillard/status/18317902506">“I believe in the importance of hard work; the obligation that we all owe to ourselves and others, to earn our keep and do our best.”﻿</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaGillard/status/18318285406">“We are privileged to live here. We best respect that great privilege by working together, shaping a better future, going forward not back.”﻿</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The first is clearly written on her behalf by someone - either that or she's speaking about herself in the third person.</p>
<p>The other two are in quotes, indicating she is quoting someone. Considering that she doesn't cite who she is quoting, I can only guess that she is quoting herself. Again, either someone is tweeting for her, or she is tweeting in the third person.</p>
<p>Social media, especially Twitter, is first person communication. It is one-to-many and simultaneous many-to-one communications, and it is marked by personal, direct and to-the-point messages.</p>
<p>I think her tweeting style is wrong, and it is going to show the tech community that she is not in touch.</p>
<p>I would make 2 suggestions for our PM.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your own tweets and do it in a personal manner; or</li>
<li>If you can't do that, make sure your staffers make it look like you are personally tweeting</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can't do one or the other of these, I'd suggest renaming your account to something like "TheOfficeOfJuliaGillard".</p>
<p><em>Update 14 July 2010</em></p>
<p><em>Since the original post, PM Gillard has made 1 more tweet:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaGillard/status/18430120681">Today I announced the Education Tax Rebate will be extended to cover uniforms. We need to make education more affordable. JG﻿</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I don't know whether someone gave her feedback along the lines of my comments above, or whether these directly got to her, but I do like that the most recent tweet is first person, and quite probably seems to be from her personally.</em></p>
