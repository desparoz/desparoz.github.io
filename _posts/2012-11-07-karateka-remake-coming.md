<p>I've always been a bit of a <a href="http://kengokan.com" target="_blank">karate</a> geek. OK, a lot of one.
Growing up, one of my favourite computer games as a young karateka was the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)" target="_blank"><em>Karateka</em></a>, on my trusty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a>. So I was fascinated to see this morning that it looks like this classic game is making a comeback, with an XBox version launched, and PSN, Steam and iOS versions coming later this month. This cool video was made to announce the releases.</p>

<p>I've always been a bit of a geek, but not much of a gamer. I've never owned a dedicated game console, such as an XBox, but instead have played games on my computing device of the day.</p>
<p>These days my iOS devices (iPhone and iPad) are my game devices of choice, but I'm still not much of a gamer. I do enjoy some word and logic games (Letterpress and Sudoku being key among those), but have to admit I'll be looking forward to playing karateka, if only for nostalgic reasons.</p>
<p>And the fact that I am still a karate geek.</p>
