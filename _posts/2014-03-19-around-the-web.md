<p>These are my Around the Web links for March 19th from 09:01 to 10:18:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1875-open-current-safari-tab-in-chrome-improved/">Open current Safari tab in Chrome - Improved - Share your Workflows - Alfred App Community Forum</a> - Another simple workflow automation, with a great @AlfredApp workflow to open the current Safari tab in Chrome (or vice versa).</li>

Since I&#039;ve been on my De-Google-ficaton kick (http://djp.me/degoog) I now use Safari as my main browser, Opera as my back up, Chrome for Google (including Google+ and YouTube) and a standalone Fluid browser for Facebook. Google and Facebook can collect whatever data they like from those browsers&mdash;I don&#039;t really use them for anything else.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro 6.3.2: Work Faster with Macros for Mac OS X</a> - I&#039;m becoming a big fan of @keyboardmaestro. I&#039;ve been a Mac automation enthusiast for some time, and love apps like Alfred, TextExpander, Hazel and 1Password for their automation power.</li>
