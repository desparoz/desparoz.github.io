<p>Email is one of the most important ways people communicate in the contemporary world, yet it is one that is often frought with problems, most of which seem to stem from a lack of attention to detail before hitting the send button.</p>

<p>Over at MacDrifter, <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2014/10/email-drafts-the-hard-way.html">Gabe Weatherhead discusses a simple concept</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last thing you write is the recipient address</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gabe discusses writing using non-email apps like <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> on iOS and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> on OSX. </p>

<p>I also use Drafts to prepare up new emails on iOS (both iPhone and iPad), but have found what I think is an ideal for preparing new emails on the Mac – the wonderful <a href="http://theletterapp.com/">Let.ter app</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/10hKK+" width="230" align="right">Let.ter starts with a simple blank screen, with four easy steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Enter a subject</li>
<li>Write the body in plain text / <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a></li>
<li>Enter the recipient(s) email address(es)</li>
<li>Preview and then send</li>
</ol>

<p>In both Let.ter and Drafts I extensively use <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> so they are both powerful yet simple apps for sending email.</p>

<p>I think that the utility behind Let.ter is that it is truly minimalist, and that it allows the use of Markdown. But since reading Gabe&#8217;s post, I am also thinking that leaving the recipient address until last before previewing is part of what makes the app useful.</p>
