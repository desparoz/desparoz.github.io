<h3>Buying Photo Gear</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve bought some photo gear lately – mostly from Australian retailers. I am always amazed about how unsatisfying the experience is for high value items. </p>

<p>Retailers always remind me that the price includes &#8216;Australian warranty&#8217; and &#8216;Australian GST&#8217;. <em>By law</em> in Australia these things <em>must</em> be included in the price quoted, so emphasising these factors is redundant.</p>

<p>I guess that retailers are sensitive to competing with (overeas) online vendors, but in many respects the lack of expertise offered and the references actually drives me towards online purchase.</p>

<p>Especially when I buy a lens and the standard upsell attempt of a filter is the best value add offered – even more so when the particular lens doesn&#8217;t have a filter mount.</p>

<p>I wonder why there aren&#8217;t photo retailers that better emphasise the photo experience, and treat the whole thing more like Apple does with their retail operations.</p>

<h3>Happy New Year</h3>

<p>Wishing everyone all the best for a safe, happy and successful 2015.</p>

<p>Today is New Years Eve, and the world&#8217;s eyes are on Sydney Harbour as one of the major focal points for seeing in the New Year.</p>

<p>This image of the Sydney Opera House, one of Harbour&#8217;s iconic landmarks, was made at sunrise a week ago, and I think it beautifully captures the dramatic air of this unique building.</p>

<p>As we move into 2015 I look forward to taking in as many sunrises and sunsets as I can!</p>
