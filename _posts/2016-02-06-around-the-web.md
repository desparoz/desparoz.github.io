Around the Web for 7 Feb 2016

<a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/02/talking-to-my-watch.html">Talking to My Watch</a>. Gabe at MacDrifter posted interesting thoughts on a $10 app (actually $14.99 in Australian dollars) - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Drafts</a> being his use case for an Apple Watch.

<blockquote>
  The Drafts Apple Watch app is a wonderfully futuristic way to write. Within two taps, I'm dictating real text that's not a total mess.
  
  I don't just use it to dictate small bits of text. I can actually dictate long passages while looking like an idiot. But, the real trick is to dictate a bunch of small messages and then combine them in the Drafts app for export as one long document.

Meanwhile, <a href="http://incompetentwriter.com/2016/01/25/write-better-blog-posts-with-workflow-and-drafts/">The Incompetent Writer</a> talks about a couple of ways of doing quick link posts from an iPad to a Wordpress blog, also using Drafts.

<blockquote>
  But, of course, not all blogging is like that. Sometimes we are responding to another person’s post, or want to connect a few different arguments; sometimes we just want to fire off a quick piece that’s nothing more than a link, a quotation, and a comment.
  
  Why should a short post take you a long time to write, when it doesn’t have to?
  
  Here are two options for writing quicker “link” posts.
