<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluebeyond/53354150/">Layabout</a> was an image I originally published in 2005 on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluebeyond/53354150/">my Flickr photostream</a>. It is a personal favourite - I like the composition and the colours.</p>
<p> With the dynamic range of the camera I was shooting on at the time (a Nikon D100), I recently wondered how its would look with HDR. I came out with 2 versions - one with a more realistic range of tones and better saturation than the original, and this one!</p>
<p> This image - Layabout Reimagined - is an example of the artsy effect that can be achieved with HDR. It can't be described as realistic - its an unrealistic impression of a real scene. But it is striking.</p>
<p> Personally, I prefer the more natural usage of HDR, but its worth experimenting and playing with, and understanding the effects you can get with the software.</p>
<p> HDR tonemapping applied to an originally made on a Nikon D100 in 2005. My goal was to experiment with the more painterly effect that can be achieved with HDR.</p>
