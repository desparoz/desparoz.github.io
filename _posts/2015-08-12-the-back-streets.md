During our visit to Crete in Greece, I had the opportunity to spend some time walking around the old city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chania">Chania</a> - a city which has been a part of both Greece and the Ottoman Empire over the centuries, although in the modern era it is firmly Greek.

I was really taken by the colourful meandering back streets, with the eclectic architecture, cobblestones, and the evident pride the people take in keeping the streets looking good.

I have to admit that I had few expectations for Crete, and was looking forward to visits to places like Istanbul. Chania was charming and pretty, and made for a great first stopover in our journey.

I would recommend it as a lovely, laid back place to visit, with a rich history and a beautiful cityscape and seascape.
