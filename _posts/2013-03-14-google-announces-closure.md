<p>In the week that I discussed <a href="/blog/2013/03/08/my-return-to-google">moving back to Google</a> for some of my usage, including RSS feeds, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">Google has announced that it is killing Google Reader</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We launched Google Reader in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years <em>usage has declined</em>. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with Google Takeout over the course of the next four months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like the way Google snuck this announcement in as the fifth bullet point on a post about spring cleaning aimed primarily at developers.</p>
<p>As Brett Terpstra said in a post on App.net:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://alpha.app.net/ttscoff/post/3822779">“Usage of Google Reader has declined” = tons of people using it for sync, but we can’t put ads in that</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Reader was free to we users, meaning we were the product, not the customer. Brett is spot on - if the majority of users access through apps where Google can't control advertising, then the service isn't viable.</p>
<p>It's one reason why I initially moved to <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">Shaun Inman's Fever</a>  - having a self hosted, <em>paid</em> platform meant that I was the customer, and that the provider would not be in a position to simply shut up shop and go away.</p>
<p>I moved back to Google Reader solely because apps like <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">Reeder</a> and <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">Mr Reader</a> don't support other RSS reader platforms, like Fever <sup id="fnref-836:a"><a href="#fn-836:a" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I wanted more than a browser interface, particularly on iPad.</p>
<p>So, we've got a bit over 3 months for the developers of Reeder and Mr Reader to support other RSS platforms. I hope that Fever is first among them. I will move back as soon as there is a good iPad app - which I fully expect will happen in that time.</p>
<p>I also wonder whether the App.net social media <em>platform</em> will have a foundation upon which developers can build an alternative RSS service.</p>

<p>I realise that <a href="/blog/2012/06/15/reeder-for-iphone-supports-fever">Reeder 3.0 for iPhone does support Fever</a>. I moved back to Google Reader because I need iPad and OSX support for it as well. Browser based access was ok, but not powerful enough for my usage.&#160;<a href="#fnref-836:a" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
