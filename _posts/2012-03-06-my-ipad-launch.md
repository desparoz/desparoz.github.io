<p> We're less than ten hours away from the big <strike>iPad 3</strike> iPad HD launch, and considering I am in my <em><a title="" target="_self" href="/blog/2012/03/04/the-ipads-of-march">iPads of March</a>,</em> it's a topic I am thinking lots about. So I thought I would make my predictions about what we might see. Of course, a lot of thesis just repeating what other, more knowledgeable people, have predicted, but what the hell.</p>
<p>So here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>iPad 3 with double pixel display, LTE and better cameras</li>
<li>iPhoto or Aperture for iPad </li>
<li>Apple TV with HD display</li>
<li>iTunes Movies  (and possibly Television shows) in HD</li>
<li>iOS 5.1</li>
<li>iWork '12, featuring built in iCloud support</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these, 1, 3 & 4 are commonly predicted. I think photo management (#2) on the iPad is definitely something we want to "<a href="http://www.iphonehacks.com/2012/02/decoding-ipad-3-event-invitation.html" target="_self" title="">see. And touch</a>".</p>
<p>As for item 5, I reckon that's a no-brainer. iOS 5.1 is going to be needed for items 1 & 3, and should e interesting to see if it has any <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/03/06/ios_51_gm_with_two_secret_features_passes_apples_testing___report.html" target="_self" title="">secret new features</a>.</p>
<p>Now item 6 is my stretch prediction. Maybe it's because it's something I <strike>want</strike> need to see. It's high time that iWork on the Mac supported iCloud, and I don't think Apple can afford to wait until the release of OSX Mountain Lion in 6 months or so.</p>
<p>So check back in tomorrow and we'll see how I went. </p>
