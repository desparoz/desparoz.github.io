<h3>RIP Lotte Hass</h3>

As a diver and underwater photographer I was saddened to hear of the recent passing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Hass">Lotte Hass</a>. She was a pioneer of women in diving, and together with her late husband, Hannes, a pioneer of underwater photography and filmography.</p>

Helensburgh is a small town that at the northern end of the Illawarra region and just south of the Greater Sydney area. 

Helensurgh was historically important as part of the original rail line down to the Illawarra coal fields, and some of the original single line tunnels and tracks dating back to the late 1800s are still in place.

The original rail line has since been replaced by a double track line. The original line, tunnels and even an old station platform serve as a historical reminder of life in the late 19th century.
