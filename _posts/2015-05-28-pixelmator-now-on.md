So it seems that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky&amp;ct=">Pixelmator</a> is now a universal app for both iPad and now iPhone.

Free to users who have purchased for iPad.

Pixelmator is certainly my favourite image editing app for Mac, iPad and now iPhone.
