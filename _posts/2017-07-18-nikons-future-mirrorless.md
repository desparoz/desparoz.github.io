Having been a Nikon SLR user from the film days through a couple of generations and into the dSLR era, I had a substantial investment in Nikon cameras and the awesome Nikkor “f-mount” glass.<a id="fnref-1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-1">[1]</a> So the shift into mirrorless for me was not a decision made lightly.

When I heard recently about <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/07/13/nikon-confirms-building-mirrorless-camera-gear-raises-bar/">Nikon pre-announcing a future mirrorless camera range</a> I thought for a moment that maybe I should have kept some of those great lenses, especially when I heard that the Nikon President said that the company aims to “<a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/07/10/nikon-new-mirrorless-camera-sleeve-president-says/">put out a very Nikon-ish mirrorless camera which is superior to rivals in quality</a>”

<strong>My decision to shift to mirrorless was made not on simply losing the mirror, but instead was about losing bulk and weight for my camera kit</strong>. As an <a href="http://desparoz.photos/underwater">underwater</a>, <a href="http://desparoz.photos/landscapes">landscape</a> and <a href="http://desparoz.photos/travel">travel</a> photographer who travels a bit with my gear, any chance to reduce bulk was welcome.<a id="fnref-2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-2">[2]</a><a id="fnref-3" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-3">[3]</a>

In <a href="http://pca.st/episode/c9a5eff0-49f3-0135-902b-63f4b61a9224">episode 193 of the Peta Pixel Photography Podcast</a>, host Sharky James (once again) expressed the view that Nikon should put out a mirrorless camera that takes f-mount glass.

I get where Sharky is coming from, but I’m not sure that the absence of a mirror will solve many problems. The f-mount lenses are built with a particular ratio of distance from the rear of the lens to the sensor. Keeping the same awesome but bulky lenses won’t have a huge effect on reducing the size of the camera body. And of course, the (large) lens size remains as is.

Since moving to mirrorless (I use the micro four-thirds, or m43, system) I have been impressed with the power of the cameras and the quality range of lenses from Olympus and Panasonic, as well as a host of other makers. And the cameras and lenses are <em>much</em> smaller.

I do hope that Nikon does something, soon, to deliver a quality camera in the mirrorless space. But simply moving to an f-mount mirrorless body may not really be solving any problems for many photographers.

Real mirrorless innovation is more than just removing a mirror.
