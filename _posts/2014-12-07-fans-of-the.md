<p><a href="http://uepi.com">Uepi Island</a>, in the Solomon Islands, is perhaps the best diving destination I&#8217;ve visited to date â€“ and I&#8217;ve had the fortune to visit a few.</p>

<p>Uepi is resplendent in corals, sharks, rays, sinkholes, caves, sheer walls, tropical fish life and even a &#8216;vertical wreck&#8217;, but for me the stand out thing about diving around Uepi is quantity, variety and size of the Gorgonian sea fans.</p>

<p>I remember diving in the Coral Sea off Far North Queensland and being told that a particular site was home to the largest Gorgonian in the world, but I don&#8217;t recall as being anywhere near as impressed with that fan as the ones at and around Uepi.</p>

<p>Getting to Uepi is an adventure in itself, but once there you are certainly greeted with unbelievably great diving, while staying at a beautiful little resort that feels like it is situated at the end of the world.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m certainly a fan of Uepi and its wonderful sea life.</p>
