Australia&#8217;s Northern Territory has two distinct seasons - the Wet (Oct-Mar) and the Dry (Apr-Sep).

The Dry Season features constantly blue skies, no clouds, and no rain. The Wet features some spectacular clouds, storms and lots of rain.

The Wet Season is also a brilliant time to make photographs out in the desert - the rains bring colours, like the vivid reds, greens and blues in this image.

The Top End is an incredibly remote place - it is quite literally hundreds of kilometres from other major towns, and thousands of kilometres from cities of any real size.

This image tells both these stories to me - the colours of the Wet Season and the isolation shown by the lonely railway tracks.

These tracks are used by &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghan">The Ghan</a>&#8217;, a weekly train service between Darwin and the southern city of Adelaide - some 3,000km (1850 miles) away.

I created this image on my Panasonic Lumix GX7, using a Lee Filters polarising filter and a 3 stop GND to balance the mid-day light. A small amount of post processing was done in Luminar.
