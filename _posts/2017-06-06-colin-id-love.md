Colin, I'd love to hear about how you use Workflow for likes, replies, etc. I hadn't really contemplated doing that, and trying to think through how it might be achieved.

As for Workflow app's future, I agree that its too soon to contemplate that it would be incorporated into iOS 11, at least now. But it wouldn't surprise me that if over the coming months we saw aspects of it incorporated into the various beta releases, before the final release. Ot I can at least hope.

I think that Apple will probably keep the app around until there's a reasonable parity with native features in iOS and those currently in the app. I think (wishfully thinking, perhaps) that the users of Workflow, and the uses of Workflow, represent a higher end of the user market place than often corresponds to apps Apple purchases. As such, this is the exact group of users/uses that Apple wants to see using iOS for 'real work', and not just for 'consumption'.

Time will tell, but early signs are encouraging.
