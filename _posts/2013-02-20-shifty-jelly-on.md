<p>Russell Ivanovic of Australia's Shifty Jelly (developer of my <a href="/blog/2013/02/05/the-best-weather-app-for-australians-pocket-weather-au">favourite weather app for iOS</a> and OSX) talk about why they <a href="http://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2013/02/20/why-android-first/">developed an Android version of their Pocket Casts 4 app before an iOS version</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no reason not to launch on Android first or iOS first in 2013. Both are massively viable platforms full of users who want to pay for great apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a mature and reasonable decision for an app developer. Focusing limited resources is critical, and it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I think it also makes sense based on competition. As Russell stated, the Android version has been a bigger seller and more profitable product for them, and there is no native app in the class. I also suspect that relatively few developers are developing &quot;Android first&quot; (for now), so there is an opportunity for them.</p>
<p>I am a committed iOS user, and will be for the foreseeable future. But I've made platform shifts in the past, and can say that what makes sense for everyone - developers and users - is to choose the platform that provides you with the most value. </p>
