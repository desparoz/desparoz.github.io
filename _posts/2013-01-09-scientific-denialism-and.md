<p>Great piece in The Conversation about <a href="/blog/one-funeral-at-a-time-big-bang-denial-and-the-search-for-truth-11127">Big Bang denial</a> (nothing to do with the TV show)
<blockquote>Extraordinary claims about the supposed failings of the Big Bang theory weren’t being backed by extraordinary evidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>It blows me away that in an age where our scientific knowledge of the world and the universe it sits in, intelligent people still deny established scientific theories such as <a href="https://twitter.com/Gordon_Baird/status/288806794439032832">climate change</a>, evolution and <a href="/blog/index.php/another-blow-to-the-anti-vaccine-movement-as-legislation-change-forces-a-name-change">vaccinations</a>. They do this while mostly ignoring the scientific process of collecting data and publishing a paper for rigorous review by <em>qualified</em> peers.</p>
<p>Scientific fact should never be about personal preference, opinion or choice. It should be about what can observed, tested and repeated.</p>
