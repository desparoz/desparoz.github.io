<p><a href="http://www.whiteribbon.org.au"><img id="wr" height="300" alt="wr" align="right" width="300" src="http://www.desparoz.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/WhiteRibbonAustralia_CampaignMessage.gif" /></a>In the Canberra Times, <a href="https://twitter.com/JennaPrice">Jenna Price</a> asks <a href="http://www.canberratimes.com.au/opinion/eyewitness-account-a-stark-reminder-20130114-2cpm8.html">why too many men still turn a blind eye or just do nothing when they witness violence against women</a>. She talked to a woman who witnessed such a situation in Canberra recently.
<blockquote>There were quite a few men who were pulling up and just watching,’’ she said yesterday. ’’A couple of guys started laughing…"</p></blockquote>
<p>It troubling to me that any “man” would still think that violence against women is acceptable or appropriate. Or funny.</p>
<p>The White Ribbon Campaign lists <a href="http://www.whiteribbon.org.au/prevention"><em>three steps towards the prevention of violence against women</em></a>, importantly including:</p>
<blockquote><p>challenging sexist and violent behaviour by speaking up about it, urging the perpetrator to seek professional help or contacting the police on 131 444 or, in an emergency, 000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course getting directly, physically involved has risk, and stepping in will often lead to a physical encounter. This needs to be carefully considered.</p>
<p>But at the very least, we should <a href="http://www.whiteribbon.org.au/whatmencando">take action</a>. Call for help, be a witness, intervene if able or perhaps create a distration.</p>
<p>Guys, take the <a href="http://www.whiteribbon.org.au/heymate">pledge</a> to never commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women.</p>
