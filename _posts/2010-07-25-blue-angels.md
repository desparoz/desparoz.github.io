<p>In 2008 we visited San Francisco. After our 14 hour flight, we checked into the Hotel California (really), and then decided to have a good walk down to the Bay.</p>
<p> We got there to masses of people, and found out that there was to be a display of the US Navy's Blue Angels team.</p>
<p> It was an amazing show, and with the bright sunny conditions, I got away with handholding a 200mm zoom.</p>
<p> The Blue Angels are amazing. As you can see here, the tight flying formations at high speeds were amazing.</p>
