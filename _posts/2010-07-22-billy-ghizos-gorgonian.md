<p>Brilliant growth of gorgonian fans and other soft and hard coral at Billy Ghizo Point, near Uepi.</p>
<p> I love the gorgonian growth at Uepi - its simply the best I've seen anywhere. In fact, to date, I'd say Uepi represents the best all round coral reef diving I've done anywhere.</p>
<p> Its probably because its so remote - to get there involves a small plane from Honiara to Seghe - an airport that consists of a bedded down coral runway and shack for a terminal building. From there you wander down to the edge of the lagoon and clamber onto a motorised canoe for the 40 minute trip across the lagoon. When you arrive at Uepi, a welcoming cool drink awaits!</p>
<p> Diving at Uepi is spectacular. Some great dives are literally right at the resort, and others are 10-20 minutes away. There are a couple of all day trips that are special, but most of the best diving is close.</p>
<p> Its the most relaxing, wonderful diving holiday location I could imagine.</p>
