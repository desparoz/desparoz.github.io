<h3>Ello</h3>

<p>There has been a lot of positive discussion on <a href="http://djp.me/e">Ello</a> about the future role of this relatively new social media platform. People like photographer <a href="https://ello.co/thomashawk/post/jb5v5-0VrMeLow9r8tp6Aw">Thomas Hawk</a>, Ello co-founder <a href="https://ello.co/budnitz/post/iUdBTMGq0O2QIUrFhtYPew">Paul Budnitz</a> and Ello user <a href="https://ello.co/bigpoppae/post/AUL1ShrULq5I7hs4Fe_45w">@bigpoppae</a> have made eloquent posts in support of the site.</p>

<p>To me the very thing that makes Ello appealing is that there is a <em>small</em> community of people, most of whom share a creative bent â€“ be that photography or other artistic endeavours.</p>

<p>I rarely use Facebook. I occasionally use <a href="http://djp.me/g">Google+</a>, and regularly use <a href="http://djp.me/t">Twitter</a>. But I find that Ello is the site that draws me in most, and I plan to interact there more than any other site in the coming year.</p>

<h2>Zig Zag Station</h2>

<p>The old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_Zag_Railway">Lithgow Zig Zag Railway</a> line in Australia&#8217;s Blue Mountains operated from 1869 to 1910, after which it was replaced by a new deviation that operates to this day.</p>

<p>The Clarence Station was the centre of a railway town during this time, but today the restored station is the main remnant of the old town.</p>

<p>Around the old station lie a number of engines, carriages and other rolling stock that formed part of a tourist railway that operated from 1975 until 2012. Many of these items were damaged in the bushfires of 2013.</p>

<p>It is possible to wander about the site and view the rolling stock and station, with no fences or signs keeping people out. That said, some areas have asbestos, so it is best to avoid trying to go into any of the rolling stock.</p>

<p>The site is a bit overgrown, but represents an important piece of the early settlement beyond the Blue Mountains.</p>
