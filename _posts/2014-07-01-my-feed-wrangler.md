<p>I can&#8217;t believe it has been a year that I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html">Feed Wrangler</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html"><img src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/635c08fbca.jpg" alt="Feed Wrangler"></a></p>

<p>Which means it has also been a year since <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2013/03/14/google-announces-closure-of-reader-service/">Google Reader was shut down</a>.</p>

<p>My use of RSS (Web feeds) has not diminished in the past 12 monthsâ€”if anything it has increased, and continues to be an incredibly important part of my daily workflow.</p>

<p>I use Feed Wrangler as a back end sync service, and don&#8217;t actually use their website very often, and don&#8217;t even have their iOS apps installed.</p>

<p>Feed Wrangler is a great sync service, and I love that I can pick the apps that best suit me at the front end<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/readkit/id588726889?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">ReadKit</a> on OSX</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Reeder</a> on iPhone</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Mr Reader</a> on iPad</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried others, including Reeder on OSX, which is good but I like that ReadKit also serves my <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> and <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> needs. Similarly I&#8217;ve played with Unread on iPhone, but keep coming back to Reeder.</p>
