<p>On a recent trip to Coffs Harbour, I spent a sunset down by the harbour at Coffs Jetty, and captured some images of a working harbour at dusk.</p>
<p>This is an HDR image made from a single RAW file. Although I took multiple bracketed exposures, the movement of the boats in the moderate wind makes it impractical to use multiple images to create an HDR image without significant blurring of the foreground.</p>
<p>I liked the moon above the boats in the Harbour.</p>
