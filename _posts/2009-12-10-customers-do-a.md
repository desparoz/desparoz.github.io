<p>One key theme that resounds in customer service is that there is rarely any benefit to be gained from telling a customer that they're wrong.</p>
<p><strong>I have to add another to that list - <em>there's rarely any benefit to telling the customer that they're stupid</em>.</strong></p>
<p>In the last week, the Reserve Bank of Australia has boosted interest rates by 25 basis points (0.25%). The first bank to act on this was Westpac, which boosted its rates by 0.45%. Hailed as a widely unpopular move, especially just before Christmas, people are calling Westpac out as being an uncaring monolith that cares not about its customers, but only about profits.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;disastrous PR move, Westpac released an add comparing banking with banana productions. <a href="/blog/watch">Check out this condescending ad</a>.</p>
<p>The ad was quickly panned by people everywhere. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/rudd-blasts-westpac-over-banana-slip-20091209-kim9.html">Even Australia's Prime Minister blasted Westpac over the "banana slip"</a>. Westpac has pulled the ads.</p>
<p>Of course, citizen journalism being what it is, there are response ads that send a clear message to Westpac exactly what people think of it.</p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how Westpac sets about rebuildings its customer image. A very clear message has been sent to customers by the bank telling them first that they're not important, and second that they're stupid.</p>
