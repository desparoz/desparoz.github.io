<p>We have entered week 2 of the Mac App Store&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/collection/organize/id29520?fcId=595822282&amp;mt=12"><em>Get Stuff Done</em></a> promotion.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s focus is on the Organise part of productivity, and features apps to reduce clutter in your mind, your house and on your Mac.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of the <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">MindNode Pro</a> app. I used to use MindManager, but I&#8217;ve found the OSX and iOS versions of the app to be lacking. Mindnode Pro works smoothly, and integrates iCloud to make the most of sycning between Macs, iPhone and iPad. It&#8217;s my current pick for mindmapping.</p>
<p>I also like the extremely useful Daisy Disk, which I use regularly to check out the data on my Mac drives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken advantage of this promotion to grab Gemini to see how it goes in cleaning up duplicate files.</p>
<p>Check out the Mac App Store&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/collection/organize/id29520?fcId=595822282&amp;mt=12"><em>Get Stuff Done</em></a> promotion if you&#8217;re in the market for apps that will assist</p>
