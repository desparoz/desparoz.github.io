In a thought-provoking post called <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/12/friction-and-silo-dead-ends.html">Friction and silo dead-ends</a> <a href="http://micro.blog/manton">Manton Reece</a> discusses the importance of <em>friction</em> in reducing fake news:

<blockquote>
  I believe in a middle-ground solution. Make it easier to post to your blog.
</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
  But don’t make thoughtless re-sharing completely frictionless. That’s what leads to fake news spreading, why hateful tweets are exposed in algorithmic trends, and why safe communities must have some amount of curation.
</blockquote>

A while back I posted about <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2017/06/11/on-likes-faves-and-sharing/">mindful blogging</a> and discussed the importance of putting thought into posts:

<blockquote>
  Clicking a link to Like or Favourite favourite takes a single second, and even less thought. People do it routinely, move on and often give no more thought whatsoever to the topic.
</blockquote>

I think Manton is right - blogging should be easy, but should still require more thought that reading a headline, clicking like or share and moving on.
