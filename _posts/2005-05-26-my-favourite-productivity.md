<p>Well, just thinking about the various productivity applications that I use to support my day-to-day life, my <a href="http://davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">GTD</a> implementation and computer time in general.&nbsp; I have learnt the hard way that keeping it simple is a good thing - and that the technology you use should support your system, rather than be the focus of your system.&nbsp; So I am very careful now to evaluate carefully whether a new technology is in fact useful, or whether its adding overhead to my system.</p>
<p>So that said, here are several applications that I use on a regular basis throughout the day</p>
<ul></p>
<li>MindManager from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://www.mindjet.com/">MindJet</a> Systems.&nbsp; Simply the best mind mapping tool I&rsquo;ve found yet</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://www.activewords.com/">ActiveWords.</a> A terrific way of re-defining the human-computer interface.&nbsp; Just say the word, and ActiveWords will take control of various pre-defined and routine functions for you.&nbsp; <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://buzzmodo.typepad.com/buzznovation/">Buzz</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://buzzmodo.typepad.com/buzzmodo">Bruggeman</a> is the guy behind ActiveWords, and is certainly a wonderful ambassador for both the Blogosphere, as well as GTD</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://www.getanagram.com/">Anagram</a> from Textual is a simple way to capture text, contacts, appointments, etc, straight to your Palm Desktop or Outlook environment.&nbsp; It is smart - you simply highlight text, and it makes an effort to determine what it is, and what information goes into various fields.&nbsp; A real time saver</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://www.copernic.com/">Copernic</a> Desktop Search.&nbsp; A fantastic and simple interface to search your desktop.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re not using desktop search, you should be.</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060224221716/http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines.</a> I&rsquo;m on the go, and regularly use three computers, plus my Palm.&nbsp; Keeping my blogroll in one place, and in sync is powerful, especially as I&rsquo;ve come to depend on Blogs (I really mean RSS feeds) as a primary news source.</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that these apps will not be "news" to most on the blogosphere, but I just thought that I should give some credit back to them for productivity benefits they have provided to me.</p>
