<p>Social Media is an important way to interact with friends and colleagues, and in many cases, with colleagues, customers and suppliers. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also be an incredible <em>productivity sinkhole</em>.</p>

<p>It is also a fact that many of the major social media services have progressively and slowly evolved (eroded) their terms of service to decrease privacy. </p>

<p>Today&#8217;s <a href="http://thedoghousediaries.com/5452">DogHouseDiaries</a> comic beautifully expresses this.</p>

<p>Personally I minimise my time on social networks, sticking mainly to <a href="http://twitter.com/desparoz">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/desparoz">LinkedIn</a>. I use Google+ and Facebook selectively, and then only in dedicated (read: sandboxed) apps, or in a browser that I <em>only</em> use for these sites. I don&#8217;t access Google or Facebook from my main browser.</p>
