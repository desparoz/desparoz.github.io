<p>A 2006 post on <a href="http://venier.blogspot.com/2006/01/now-is-gtd-really-about-time.html">Pascal Veniers blog</a> made me think a little about a topic that I’ve long considered and held some thoughts on. This topic is that of <em>time management</em>.</p>
<p>It is clear that I am an example of what you could call a productivity geek. I’ve studied various methodologies and used various tools. I’ve been on a search for the holy grail of personal productivity. You’ll note that I rarely use the expression time management. This is simply because I don’t believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>You see time cannot be managed</strong>. It is a constant. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day. That makes a grand total of 1440 minutes in a day. No matter how hard you “manage” your time, you cannot possibly produce even one extra minute in a day. 1440 is a critical number — it is rock solid and rock steady. Time frankly refuses to be managed, despite our best efforts and great intentions.</p>
<p>I’ve held this view for many years, so when I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.davidco.com/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> a few years back, I was instantly intrigued. Why? Because David Allen never talks about time management. He talks about action management.</p>
<p>Actions are the only things we manage. Eating, sleeping, meditating, exercising, work, rest, play are all actions. Some actions are standalone, some are part of a greater “project”. But actions are, by definition, the things we do.</p>
<p>So give up trying to manage time — time is an external concept, and steadfastly refuses to be managed. Instead, look within yourself and focus your efforts on your actions — on making the most use of your 1440 minutes in a day. You will be more productive.</p>
