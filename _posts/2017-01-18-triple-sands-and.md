Singapore is an incredibly photogenic city, with so many interesting sites to see and capture.

One great area to spend time is around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Bay,_Singapore">Marina Bay</a> area. The architecture here is spectacular, with some of the more interesting examples including the Marina Bay Sands complex (the three buildings ‘connected’ by a ‘ship’ on the roof, and the famous Double Helix pedestrian bridge, seen in this image.

Marina Bay itself is fascinating, with the entire bay having been dammed and converted into a freshwater reservoir, providing an important alternative freshwater source for the city-state.

As a key part of the Singapore ‘downtown core’ area, Marina Bay is an area worth exploring for the travelling photographer.

This image was created in the late afternoon, as I was scouting around for angles for sunset/golden hour/blue hour imagery. With the use of a polariser and ND filters, and some minor post processing in <a href="http://djp.me/luminar">Luminar</a>, I am very happy with the image.
