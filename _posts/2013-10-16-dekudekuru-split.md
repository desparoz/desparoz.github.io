<p>Dekudekuru is a reef close to <a href="http://www.uepi.com/">Uepi Island Resort</a> in the Solomon Islands. It is an ideal place for both over and under shots and images made from underwater shooting the nearby jungle canopy. This is due to the protected shallow waters of the reef inside a reef, and the nearby jungle canopy.</p>

<p>Under &amp; over shots like this have held a lot of fascination for me for some time. There&#8217;s a reason that you see comparatively few of them published - they&#8217;re difficult to setup and difficult to execute well.</p>

<p>To make an under &amp; over image you must shoot through air and water simultaneously, with the different lighting that brings. You need to minimise water droplets on the &#8220;dry&#8221; part of the image. And you need to focus near and far.</p>

<p>To create this image I used a very wide angle lens, used a small aperture for depth of field and shot in shallow, clear water on a bright, sunny day. Even then, this image was the best of quite a bunch, and is far from perfect. But I am quite happy with it!</p>
