The original web-based underwater photography magazine, [UwP Mag](http://uwpmag.com) has reached a major milestone with its **100th issue** being published.

Well done to Peter Rowlands and all involved for this magnificent achievement.

I had an article about [The PLACEBO Principle](http://www.desparoz.com/the-placebo-principle-for-underwater-photography/) published way back in issue no. 8.

Its been a couple of years since I made underwater photos, but it is something I am planning to get back into this year. UwP 100 is spurring me on!
