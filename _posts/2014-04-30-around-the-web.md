<p>These are my Around the Web links for April 29th through April 30th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.prezi.com/latest/2014/4/28/engaging-your-audience-slides-vs-prezi.html">Engaging your audience: slides vs. Prezi</a> - I love Prezi. I&#039;d love to use it more but haven&#039;t truly fitted it into my presenting workflow yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/launch-center-pro-guide/">Automating iOS: A Comprehensive Guide to Launch Center Pro</a> - Great guide to using Launch Center Pro. Great app - even if &quot;centre&quot; is misspelt.</li>
<li><a href="http://techpinions.com/the-ipads-curse/29816">The iPad&rsquo;s Curse</a> - Great question posed by Ben Bajarin via Shawn Blanc: &quot;The iPad&rsquo;s curse may be it can do many things well but does it do anything better?&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://visualwilderness.com/quick-tips/critique-is-misunderstood">Critique is Misunderstood</a> - Varina Patel on why critiquing (specifically in photography, but really in any field) is a give and take thing, and why its a valuable development tool for the one giving the critique as well as the one receiving it.</li>
<li><a href="http://davidchartier.com/gerry-conway-the-comixology-outrage-comicbook-com/">Gerry Conway: The ComiXology Outrage | Comicbook.com</a> - &quot;Amazon knows chap prices but it doesn&#039;t know a thing about great experiences&quot;. It is the experience that counts for reading, particularly comics. Amazon may have misread this market.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2148306/why-newsstand-needs-to-go-away.html">&rarr; Why Newsstand needs to go away</a> - There are some Newsstand magazines I like, but to be honest I generally prefer the experience in standalone apps or Zinio</li>
<li><a href="http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/04/27/gerry-conway-the-comixology-outrage/">&rarr; The ComiXology Outrage</a> - Marco Arment provides an interesting perspective on the ongoing discussion about Amazon&#039;s changes to Comixology</li>
