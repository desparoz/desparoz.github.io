<p>MacRumors has today reported on a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/10/siris-accuracy-continues-to-improve-as-apple-works-to-reduce-reliance-on-google/">study by Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster showing improvements in performance of the iOS virtual assistant Siri</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, who has regularly assessed Siri&#8217;s accuracy in terms of correctly interpreting and answering queries, has issued the latest version of his Siri report card, noting that Siri has continued to improve under iOS 7, particularly in terms of being able to properly interpret questions being asked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My anecdotal feeling corresponds with this view - not only is Siri (I service I use daily) getting better in terms of the range of information being sourced, but it is doing a far better job of interpreting my inputs. When I previously asked it to call my colleague <em>Mike Davey</em> I would get a response along the lines of &#8220;Des, I don&#8217;t understand. What do you mean by call <em>my baby</em>?&#8221;. Now it gets Mike Davey everytime.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>Marco Armant (<a href="http://twitter.com/marco">@marco</a>) <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/10/siri-accuracy-improving">isn&#8217;t quite so enamoured</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is good, but the biggest problem I always have with Siri is reliability, not quality of answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a while I got a lot of responses indicating Siri&#8217;s apology for being down. I haven&#8217;t had that experience now in several months. My experience is more like that of Federico Viticci (<a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">@viticci</a>):<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s still far from perfect, but I’ve been using Siri on a daily basis for phone calls, directions, and Wikipedia integration. I particularly appreciate how iOS 7 made Siri smarter in understanding pronouns, indirect speech, and verb conjugations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, Siri is an important part of my daily iOS usage, and I generally find it to be reliable and constantly improving. And I still love finding Easter Eggs.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>I know I could&#8217;ve trained it to interpret that name better, but I had never got around to it. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Maybe the Australian Siri and the Italian Siri share the same servers, or at least use different servers than American Siri&#8230; <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never asked Siri about the plot of the movie <em>Inception</em> give it a try. <a href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
