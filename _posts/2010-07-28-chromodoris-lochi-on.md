<p>This small nudibranch (Chromodoris lochi) was found crawling along the finger of a sponge on a dive trip to Tawali in PNG.</p>
<p> Nudibranchs are perhaps the most photographed creature in the sea, due to the fact that stay still for photographers, and that they can be very attractive subjects.</p>
<p> The key to a good nudibranch photo, I believe, is to find a perspective that is interesting, and also to get a background (negative space) that complements the subjects, and at least doesn't distract from it.</p>
<p> This is one of my personal favourites as it is shot from front on (not tops down) and has a non-distracting background. The left to right orientation gives the appearance of motion.</p>
<p> Additionally the rhinopores are sharp, and the depth-of-field provides a good blur (bokeh) through the rest of the image.</p>
