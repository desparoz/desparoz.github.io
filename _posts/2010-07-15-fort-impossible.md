<p>Bare Island Fort, La Perouse was the setting of parts of one of the Mission Impossible movies, hence the title of this image. Its apt, because the beautiful colours and saturation aren't really possible in traditional photography, and rely on HDR.</p>
<p> Three images were made about 30 minutes before sunrise - just as the morning twilight started. One was correctly exposed, and then one was 2 stops under and one 2 stops over. The three images were then merged in PhotoMatix Aperture plug-in, and tonemapped.</p>
<p> Sunrise was at 6.58am. Bare Island is a very popular scuba diving location only 20 minutes south of Sydney city, close to Sydney airport.</p>
