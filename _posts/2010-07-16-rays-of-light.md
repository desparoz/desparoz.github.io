<p>This is another image from our trip to Uepi in September 2009. This one was made at a site called General Store, which featured swim throughs and overhangs.</p>
<p> I was quite taken by the effect of light rays streaming down in many of these spots, and was quite keen to capture this light.</p>
<p> This image was made with a 12-24mm wide angle lens on my Nikon D200. Basic adjustment was made in Aperture, and a small amount of tone-mapping was applied in Photomatix.</p>
