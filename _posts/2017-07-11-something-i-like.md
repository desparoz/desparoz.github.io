<p><em>Something I like: <a class="u-like-of" href="http://thesweetsetup.com/brian-hendrixs-mac-setup/">Brian Hendrix&#039;s Mac setup &ndash; The Sweet Setup</a>...</em></p>Interesting to see other people's workflows and setups in the macOS/iOS worlds.

Like Brian, I moved from Windows, and at first used a VM for Windows apps. After a while I found I was no longer needing any of those apps, and went full Mac.

Interesting that Brian finds a Windows VM on Parallels is faster than on a PC.
