Actually, its not often an app goes onto my main screen, let alone the dock, so when this does occur its really saying something about the potential of that app.
David Sparks of the <a href="http://macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a> podcast has mentioned once or twice about an iPhone app called <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a>, which is a quick way to collect thoughts and info as they arise. David, along with his co-host <a href="http://katiefloyd.me">Katie Floyd</a>, have become people who I pay attention to when it comes to productivity on Mac and iOS devices, and when David recently blogged about the release of a <a href="http://macsparky.com/2012/8/drafts-for-iphone-and-ipad">new version of Drafts for the iPhone along with a new version for the iPad</a>, it was time to give the app a try.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/drafts-2-0-and-drafts-for-ipad/">Brett Terpstra</a> and the <a href="http://timemanagementninja.com/2012/08/the-best-app-to-capture-quick-ideas-on-your-iphone-ipad/">Time Management Ninja</a> blog also posted about the release of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">Drafts 2</a> / <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">Drafts for the iPad</a> only reinforced the need for me to check it out.</p>
<p>This “quick collect” system fits nicely with <a href="http://djp.me/gtd">David Allen’s <em>Getting Things Done</em> (GTD)</a> as it allows an iPhone user to quickly collect ideas and thoughts as they arise, so that they can be processed and organised later for action.</p>
<p>On opening Drafts, the first thing seen is a blank note. You can quickly type your thought and leave the app, no other action required. By default, if you reopen the open more than 60 seconds later, it will automotically start a new note, but of course you can review older captured thoughts. If you’re running Drafts on both iPhone and iPad, there is a seamless syncing capability of the notes.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your drafts, its quite simple to later do something with them. You can Tweet, post to Facebook, send emails or messages, send to apps like Byword or DayOne, or other web services like Evernote and Dropbox.</p>
<p>As a writer, I like that Drafts supports John Gruber’s <a href="http://djp.me/markdown">Markdown</a>. This allows me to easily integrate Drafts to my writing workflow, which is built around Byword as my editing device. From Byword, its easy for me to then export to my Squarespace or Wordpress blogs, or to apps like Pages, Scrivener or iBooks Author. My only criticism of Drafts is that the Markdown preview process seems a little flakey at this time. I am sure that will be fixed shortly.</p>
<p>I like the seamless, low-threshhold method of quickly capturing thoughts and ideas. The app has a lot of power, and easily integrate into many workflows. As with any capture device (such an in-trays and inboxes), the trick is to ensure that it’s contents are regularly processed and organised for action. Get <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a> for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">iPad</a></p>
