<p>My photo of the day today is a picture of the Taiyo wreck in Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands. A Taiwanese fishing vessel on its maiden voyage ran aground on the adjacent reef. The sheer wall of the reef drops down to several thousand metres!</p>
<p> During the salvage, the vessel slipped bank and sank, stern first. The stern got wedged in a coral outcrop at just over 40m, and now rests vertically - one of only two known vertical wrecks in the world. The bow (pictured) comes to about 2m.</p>
<p> On the day we dived the wreck in September 2009, the water was uncharacteristically murky with a lot of sediment. I decided to shoot mostly with natural light (without strobes). Even so, the majority of the images had a gloomy green cast. Gloomy is ok for wrecks, but not so the green cast. I felt that the image may be better in monochrome, and this is the result.</p>
<p> Would appreciate any feedback!</p>
