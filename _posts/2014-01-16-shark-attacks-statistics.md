<p>A cursory glance at statistics can lead to fear and a perception that shark attacks are on the rise. This can lead to bad policy, such as the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-06/wa-government-standing-by-shark-cull-after-protest/5185802">shark cull in Western Australia</a>, with the acting Premier Kim Hames vocalising the policy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the numbers have significantly increased in the last three years and we believe the Government had to do something about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the reality is that a shark attack is, mathematically, random chance. As stated by Christopher Neff in <a href="http://theconversation.com/shark-bite-statistics-can-lie-and-the-result-is-bad-policy-21789?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+17+January+2014&amp;utm_content=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+17+January+2014+CID_92bf193ea12517cc0ccf7c322f83b721&amp;utm_source=campaign_monitor&amp;utm_term=Shark%20bite%20statistics%20can%20lie%20and%20the%20result%20is%20bad%20policy">The Conversation</a> article, there are an enormous number of human-shark interactions (most of which the humans remain blissfully unaware of) that are never counted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The coin is tossed all the time, but we only count the tragedies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who spends a lot of time in, on and arond the ocean, I have knowingly had many encounters with sharks. Only once was I aware of a shark being uncomfortable with my presence. I moved away.</p>

<p><em>Shark attacks are undoubtedly horrific events when they occur</em>. But so are car accidents. Car accidents, however, are far more frequent<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and are far less random in their occurence.</p>

<p>Navy clearance diver and shark attack survivor, Paul de Gelder, has posted a <a href="http://pauldegelder.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/kill-em-all-firstly-for-anyone-that-has.html">great response to the WA Shark Cull</a>. He makes a passionate case against the cull, but I think his conclusion says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ocean is not our back yard swimming pool and we shouldn&#8217;t expect it to be one. It&#8217;s a wondrous, beautiful, dangerous place that provides our planet with all life. It and it&#8217;s inhabitants need protection from those that would do it harm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Killing sharks as a blanket policy is a knee-jerk reaction, and is bad policy. Doing it based on poor interpretation of random chance is short-sighted.</p>

<p>According the <a href="http://taronga.org.au/animals-conservation/conservation-science/australian-shark-attack-file/latest-figures">Australian Shark Attack File, Taronga Zoo</a>, as of this writing, there have been 202 unprovoked, fatal attacks by sharks in Australia since 1791. That&#8217;s slightly less than 1 per year. In the last 50 years, there have been 50 attacks. Compare this with <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1403D6858D94D157CA257B2E000D750C?opendocument">1,543 deaths from transport accidents in 2011 alone</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
