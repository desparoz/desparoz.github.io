<p>As I stated when <a href="http://djp.me/maps">iOS 6 was first released</a>, map data has to work properly because of its intrinsic relationship with, well, all aspects of life.
A lot of people bemoaned Apple having dropped Google maps, because Google has been developed over many years, whereas Apple’s maps were a version 1 product. Google has also been much praised about the accuracy of its mapping data, as a result of, among other things, the fact the Google sends people out to check the mapping data.</p>
<p>I expect Apple will continue to improve their mapping data, and find the UI of their app to be good. But like most, we need the data to be accurate. Even <a href="http://www.vicpolicenews.com.au/more-news/11081-police-concerned-with-apple-ios-6-mapping-system.html">Victoria Police in Australia has made specific warnings</a> about trusting Apple Maps in navigating to the town of Mildura due to inaccurate map data.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5968068/google-maps-is-now-available-for-ios-devices">Google Maps was released for iOS</a>, I was keen to try out the app to see if the app would give me the best of both worlds in terms of accurate data and a simple UI.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.desparoz.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1112.png"><img title="IMG_1112" height="300" alt="" width="200" class="size-medium wp-image-319" src="http://www.desparoz.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1112.png" /></a></p>
<p>So I downloaded the app, and yesterday tried it out to navigate from Parramatta in Sydney’s west to a major shopping centre called Castle Towers. Castle Towers is a major centre that has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Towers">open since 1982</a>, and is even home to one of the 7 <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/retail/castletowers/">Apple Stores in Sydney</a>.</p>
<p>Google Maps’ UI was great, and it took me seconds to work out how to plan a route, and start the turn-by-turn navigation function. I <em>really</em> like the turn-by-turn experience, with clear information on the next turn, and (where appropriate) information about immediately following turns. In short, I like it, and can see this app replacing TomTom as my major navigation tool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.desparoz.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1114.png"><img title="Street View" height="300" alt="" width="200" class="size-medium wp-image-318" src="http://www.desparoz.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1114.png" /></a></p>
<p>The app got me close to the shopping centre, <em>but not to it</em>. In fact, it told me I had arrived when I was in a leafy surburban street about 2 blocks from the centre. Not knowing the centre, I didn’t realise it was two blocks behind me, so I drove further down the street. A check of Google Street View in the Google Maps app showed me that there was no shopping centre there! (see photo)</p>
<p>So while nowhere as serious as the Mildura incident, the hallowed Google Maps failed me on its first usage, and it failed to find a major complex that is far from a recent addition.</p>
<p>After leaving Castle Towers, I set a course to visit Tamworth in regional NSW, a major town about 5–6 hours from Sydney. The app worked brilliantly, and tracked time and distance extremely well. In fact, it seems to estimate time a bit better than Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Plotting a trip home from Tamworth, Google Maps tells me it will be 5 hours 42 minutes, whilst Apple Maps predicts 5 hours 14 minutes. I bet that even in perfect traffic, 5:42 will be a best case scenario.</p>
<p>Google Maps will probably be my go-to app for turn-by-turn navigation, based on user experience, turn-by-turn functionality and overall better map data. I like the app, but will keep using the Apple Maps app as well to see how it improves.</p>
