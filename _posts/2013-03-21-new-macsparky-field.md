<p><a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown"><img src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/f2bab17781.jpg" align="right" width="300"></a>Since the dawn of this weblog, I've undertaken different approaches to my writing. I've used different content management systems (it's currently a self-hosted Wordpress blog, but I also have Squarespace and Scriptogr.am sites), and I've used a variety of tools and apps to making writing for this blog easier. Although I have a reasonable handle on HTML, I am not a coder, and hate writing in it. It's a poor format for editing, and an even worse format if I want to re-use my writing for other purposes.</p>
<p>My current writing process involves <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">Multimarkdown Composer</a> and <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Mars Edit</a> on OSX and <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">Byword</a> and <a href="http://www.tomwitkin.com/poster/">Poster</a> on iOS. I could just use the WYSIWYG interface on MarsEdit or Poster, but find that I like to write first in plain text so that I can edit and re-use. Frankly, the HTML rendered through most WYSIWYG tools is pretty clunky.</p>
<p>The "glue" that binds these disparate sites and apps together, however, is John Gruber's <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> syntax, which makes writing easy, regardless of whether I start in Drafts on iOS or nvAlt on OSX and then continue in Byword/Multimarkdown Composer, or start straight in Byword/MMC. Every time I start, I start in Markdown.</p>
<p>Markdown is quite easy to learn,  but it is still a little "geeky". It is also cool because most non-geeky people could read a text document in Markdown and get it. And it renders well in a variety of outputs - HTML obviously, but it also works nicely for written publications.</p>

It follows on from his wonderful <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless">Paperless</a> Field Guide, which is one of the best resources for Mac users (in particular) who want to move to a paperless lifestyle.</p>
<p>I saw David's post today announcing the release of the <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/new-field-guide-markdown">new Markdown Field Guide</a>. I immediately downloaded it from the iBooks store (it's also available as a PDF book) and will start reading it today. I may review it in detail later on, but if my experience with the MacSparky Field Guide's <em>and</em> Markdown is any indication, this is one that any writer (particularly for the web) will want to download today.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown">MacSparky Markdown Field Guide</a> is available for A$9.99 from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/markdown/id622433972?mt=11">iBooks Store</a>, or from the MacSparky website.</p>
