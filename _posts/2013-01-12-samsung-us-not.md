<p>According to CNET, the US head of Samsung's PC &amp; tablet business has indicated that <a href="/blog/8301-34439_1-57563340/uh-oh-windows-rt-samsungs-got-second-thoughts">Samsung has dropped plans to bring to market (at least in the US) a Windows RT based tablet</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abary noted Samsung reached its decision about he device, dubbed the Ativ Tab, for two main reasons. First, feedback from its retail partners indicated demand for such products is only modest. Second, Samsung determined it would take a lot of investment to inform consumers about the benefits of Windows RT</p>
