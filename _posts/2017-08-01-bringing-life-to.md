My passion is still photography &#x2013; capturing wonderful <a href="http://djp.me/land">landscapes</a>, <a href="http://djp.me/sea">seascape</a>, <a href="http://djp.me/uw">underwater</a> and <a href="http://djp.me/travel">travel</a> scenes is what inspires my photography. I have put together some short videos (mostly <a href="http://djp.me/tide">timelapse</a>), but the truth of it is that still images grab me, and the challenge of creating an image that tells a story in the sort time a shutter is open is motivating.

Movement, however, catches the eye, and although a good still image can imply movement there are a number of emerging methods of bringing life to still images.

Since the middle of last year I have been <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2016/08/27/playing-around-with-plotagraph-pro/">Playing around with Plotagraph Pro</a> as a way of bringing some animation to still images. I like the results, and Plotagraph Pro in that time has come out of beta, introduced new <a href="https://www.plotagraphpro.com/buynow">pricing tiers (including a free one)</a> and started to rollout social sharing features.

The <a href="http://plotagraphs.com">Plotagraphs</a> website features some very impressive examples of Plotagraphs (Plotagraphy??) by some very talented image makers.

Recently the Plotagraph team, with the support of image makers like Trey Ratcliff, has released an iOS app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/plotagraph/id1244669793?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4Ky">Plotagraph +</a> which brings the functionality to mobile devices<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. Alongside <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2017/07/29/rockpool-sunrise/">Affinity Photo for iPad</a> this app is truly positioning the iPad Pro at the core of <em>my</em> on-the-go photo workflow.

I created this Plotagraph in a few short minutes on the iPad on Sunday afternoon.

<br></figure>Essentially the <em>green-dots-leading-to-red-dashed-lines-to-blue-arrowheads</em> are what I set for the direction and speed of movement, and the red dots near the horizon are anchor points that prevent movement beyond them.</p>

<h2>Plotagraph+ Pros</h2>

<ul><li>Easy (very easy) to use.</li><li>Easy output to video and animated PNG formats.</li><li>Price effective.</li></ul>

<h2>Plotagraph+ Cons</h2>

<ul><li>No output to animated GIF for simple sharing<a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>.</li><li>App crashes if you try to load a RAW file<a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>.</li><li>Only sharing option is through Photos. I&apos;d love to be able to share to Dropbox or other galleries (such as Plotagraphs.com) more directly.</li></ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

I love this app, and the promise it provides for a fun and easy way to give life to images. Like HDR<a href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> Plotagraphs will likely allow image makers to express their worldview in their own art, and of course beauty will be in the eye of the beholder. A lot of Plotagraphs will be good, some will be great and some will have faces that only the owner could love.

For me, a relatively small portion of my images will be Plotagraphs, but I will have fun creating and sharing some when it suits the image and the story I am trying to tell with it.
