Last week I published a post on the <a href="http://desparoz.com/blog/2013/4/18/state-of-play-fever-rss-and-apps"><em>State of Play for Fever RSS and Apps</em></a>, providing an overview of the iOS and OSX apps available to support Shaun Inman&#8217;s brilliant, self-hosted, RSS system <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a>. </p>

<p>After a long period of little development on the app front, this last week has seen some exciting developments. I hope these new developments are a sign of things to come. I plan to review each of these separately over the next week or so, but thought a quick update would be worthwhile.</p>

<h2 id="feverappsformacosx">Fever Apps for Mac OSX</h2>

<h3 id="readkit-osxus4.99">ReadKit - OSX (US$4.99)</h3>

<p><a href="http://readkitapp.com/"><img src="http://d.pr/i/r6sx+" align="right" width="150"></a>
<a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a> is a wonderful tool for Mac OSX, providing support for browser based reading and sharing services like Instapaper, Pocket, Pinboard and more, in a native app. It has already been an important part of my workflow for sometime, and the addition of support Fever in the beta of version 2 is an exciting development.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re a Fever user or not, <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a> should be a part of your reading workflow.</p>

<h2 id="feverappsforios">Fever Apps for iOS</h2>

<h3 id="sunstroke-iosuniversalus4.99">Sunstroke - iOS Universal (US$4.99)</h3>

<p><a href="https://goneeast.com/sunstroke/index.html"><img src="http://d.pr/i/ABmM+" align="right" width="150"></a>
<a href="https://goneeast.com/sunstroke/index.html">Sunstroke</a> has displaced Reeder as my go-to Fever RSS app on iPhone, and since the release of version 1.4 last week, on iPad. Sunstroke has support for a wide range of social sharing and read later services (almost as wide as Reeder), and it has a gorgeous UI and a UX (user experience) that works best with my workflow.</p>

<p>At US$4.99 (A$5.49), Sunstroke is well priced <em>as a universal app</em> <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and I suggest that this is <em>the one</em> iOS app for Fever, at this time. The developer is extremely responsive on <a href="http://app.net/atdrendel">App.net</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/gone_east">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ashes-iosuniversalus5.99">Ashes - iOS Universal (US$5.99)</h3>

<p><a href="http://ashesapp.com/"><img src="http://d.pr/i/Obym+" align="right" width="150"></a>
The <a href="http://ashesapp.com/">Ashes</a> app has been (re-) released as a universal app for iOS devices at an introductory price of US$5.99 (A$6.49). According to the website, it will increase to US$8.99 from 9 May. Ashes fully supports all native features of Fever, and has an elegant design. It is visually pleasing to use, and seems very stable. </p>

<p>At US$5.99 Ashes is appropriately priced for a niche product that supports both iPhone and iPad, and makes a good choice for someone wanting an all round app for Fever. The developer is actively talking to users on <a href="http://twitter.com/ashesapp">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://app.net/ashesapp">App.net</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reeder-iphoneus2.99">Reeder - iPhone (US$2.99)</h3>

<p><a href="http://reederapp.com/iphone/"><img src="http://d.pr/i/fcFp+" align="right" width="150"></a>
Version 3.1 of Reeder for iPhone was released during the last week. This added support to the iPhone version of the app (which already supports Fever) for Feedbin. </p>

<p>Clearly the developer is focused on iPhone and Feedbin at this time, and so we will have to wait a while longer for iPad and OSX support for Fever. With apps like ReadKit and Sunstroke, this is no longer the problem it was only a week or so back.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://desparoz.com/blog/2013/4/18/state-of-play-fever-rss-and-apps"><em>State of Play</em></a> article, I mentioned that I thought Sunstroke was overpriced. Compared to Reeder as an iPhone only app, that stood. But for a universal app for iOS, the price is just fine! <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
