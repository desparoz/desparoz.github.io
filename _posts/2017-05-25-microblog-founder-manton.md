micro.blog founder Manton Reece has posted about the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/05/micro-blog-photos.html">importance of photo-blogging</a> as part of the overall (micro) blogging approach.

I agree whole-heartedly, and will add distribution to the micro-blog as part of my photo publishing workflow.
