<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/xbZx+" align="right" width="400">I&#8217;ve written before about how I believe that system interuptions should be completely disabled during presentations, and how <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2013/05/10/windows/">Windows devices shouldn&#8217;t be used for presentations if possible</a> because of their propensity to interupt the user anytime.</p>

<p>In my experience, Mac OSX devices are far better for presentations because the system tends to not interupt you when doing important things. With the recent enhancements to the notifications functionality, there is a growing possibility that individual apps will popup notifications that will appear on screen. So you might get a text message on screen, or a news update, or similar.</p>

<p>OSX Mavericks has a great way to avoid this. In System Preferences navigate to Notifications (System Preferences&gt;Notifications) and in the Do Not Disturb option check the box to turn on DND &#8220;When mirroring to TVs and projectors&#8221;.</p>

<p>Attention to detail like this will allow your presentations to be smoother and you will be less likely to have your presentation, train of thought and audience&#8217;s attention interupted.</p>
