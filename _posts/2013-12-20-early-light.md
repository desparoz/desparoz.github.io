<p>The Australian War Memorial in Canberra is a wonderful celebration of the contributions and sacrifices by the Nation&#8217;s sailors, soldiers and airmen at home and abroad. Whilst war should not be celebrated, we should never forget the hardship and loss suffered in the name of our national interests.</p>

<p>The War Memorial has a spectacular straight line view to Parliament House. From the War Memorial visitors can see what was fought for - democracy and freedom. From Parliament House the government of the day can see the reminder of the sacrifices made for that.</p>
