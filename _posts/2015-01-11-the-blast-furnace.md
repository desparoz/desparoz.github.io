<h3>The Ambivert&#8217;s Guide to Street Photography</h3>

I recently read a fascinating ebook called <a href="https://scottwyden.com/ebooks/"><em>The Ambivert&#8217;s Guide to Street Photography</em></a> by Scott Wyden Kivowitz.

I am quite keen on progressing my street photography skills, but I don&#8217;t always feel comfortable just taking a photo of someone, and I don&#8217;t relish the idea of approaching a stranger to ask their permission to do so.

In <em>The Ambivert&#8217;s Guide to Street Photography</em>, Scott provides good strategies to give it a go.

<em>The Ambivert&#8217;s Guide to Street Photography</em> is available from the author&#8217;s site as a PDF, and is also available from the iBook and Kindle stores.

On Boxing Day Belinda and I got out of town for a couple of days, traveling up to Lithgow along the Bell&#8217;s Line of Road, and coming back via the Blue Mountains.

It was a beautiful couple of days exploring Lithgow, a town that I had not visited previously. It is a place that is full of history, including having been the original home of Australia&#8217;s steel industry.

The Old Blast Furnace preceded the steel works in both the Hunter and Illawarra regions.

I found it amazing that this old structure is still standing, albeit in a quite dilapidated state. I also found it amazing that you can freely wander about the site, given there are a lot of deep holes and pits.

I was pleased that I could wander around as it is a photogenic site, and I hope that photographers and others can continue to explore locations like this.

As I wandered about the Blast Furnace, I could not help but wonder about the efforts and hardwork of the people who built and operated the old Blast Furance.
