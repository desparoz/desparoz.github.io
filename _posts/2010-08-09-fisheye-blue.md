<p>One of the more common fish seen at many Sydney divesites is the Eastern Blue Wrasse (commonly called a blue groper). </p>
<p> At Oak Park, near Cronulla, these fish are so friendly that they will swim right up to divers. This one was actually getting in the way of my photos, so I decided to make close up images of its features.</p>
<p> The Eastern Blue Wrasse is a protected species in NSW. Once quite threatened, their nature makes them easy targets for spearfishers.</p>
