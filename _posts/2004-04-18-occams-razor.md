<p><em>This entry was created on my old blog, and has been copied over, simply because I think it is still relevant.</em><br/><br/>Named for William of Ockham, Occam's Razor is summed up by the following Latin phrase "Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccsitate"<br/><br/>Literally translated, this means "Plurality should not be assumed without necessity".<br/><br/>More simply ('scuse the pun) it means that when there exists a simple solution, don't search for a more obvious one. Or to quote Einstein - "Everything should be made a simple as possible, but no simpler".<br/><br/>Now this a theme worth living in life - one thats easier said than done!Occam</p>
