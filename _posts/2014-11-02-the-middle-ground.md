<p>Over the past few months I have started drafting a number of posts that I have yet to complete. </p>

<p>I setup the <a href="http://djp.me/pinboard">Around the Web <em>link blog</em></a> on <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> as a place to track links of interest, with the idea being that I could have short comments. These, in theory, get rolled up into regular <em>Around the Web</em> posts. For several reasons – some technical, some personal – this process has been a little broken.</p>

<p>The idea was that these would fill a gap between <a href="http://djp.me/twitter">Twitter posts</a> and longer form posts, which would become the focus of writing here. I think this gap is too great.</p>

<p>Apparently I am not the only one, with people like <a href="http://waxy.org/2014/10/middling/">Andy Baio</a>, <a href="http://scribbling.net/2014/10/16/short-form-blogging/">Gina Trapani</a> and <a href="http://sixcolors.com/post/2014/10/bigger-than-a-tweet/">Jason Snell</a> deciding that their blogs will be for anything longer than a tweet, even if it is only a paragraph or two. Of course people like <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> have taken that approach all along.</p>

<p>So, this blog will probably have more regular, short form comment. Some posts might be quick thoughts while others might be expanded links. Of course, the occasional long form post and semi-regular <em>Photos of the Week</em> will continue.</p>

<p>Themes will continue to focus on workflows in productivity, photo and presentations, and the technology that empowers them. But I will continue to post other things that interest me.</p>

<p>I hope this will become a better <em>middle ground</em> of posting for me.</p>
