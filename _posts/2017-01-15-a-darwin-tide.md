With a full moon in early January, Darwin experienced some of the largest tidal exchanges of our time here - not as big as in early December, but up there. This provided an excellent opportunity to capture a time-lapse video.

Friday 13 January was a great time to capture a time-lapse, which I commenced shortly after the load tide of 0.57m at 12:52pm, and ran until just after the peak high of 7.86m at 7:27pm, a tidal exchange of some 7.29m! With the sun having set at 7:19pm, the end of the timelapse corresponded nicely with blue hour, a great time to shoot.

A good place to really notice the change is with the barge pictured in the lower right - it starts off resting on mud, but by the end is moving around in the water as youâ€™d expect from a vessel tied off to a wharf and in no way touching the bottom.

The massive tidal change is one of the key features of Darwin Harbour, and a great way to tell this story is with the use of time-lapse photography.

I captured one image every 10 seconds over the period on my Panasonic Lumix GX7, using a <a href="http://miops.com">MIOPS Smart Trigger</a> to control the intervals. I then compiled the images on my laptop using ON1 Photo RAW to pre-process the images, then the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/time-lapse/id451563308?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Time-Lapse</a> app for macOS to compile the time lapse sequence, before completing the movie in iMovie.

For this shoot I also used Willy Weather to get <a href="http://tides.willyweather.com.au/nt/darwin/darwin.html">Darwin Tide</a> and <a href="http://sunrisesunset.willyweather.com.au/nt/darwin/darwin.html">Sunset</a> information. <a href="http://www.willyweather.com.au/">Willy Weather</a> is an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/weather-by-willyweather/id592978502?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">app</a> and <a href="http://www.willyweather.com.au/">website</a> I use regularly in planning photographic outings.
