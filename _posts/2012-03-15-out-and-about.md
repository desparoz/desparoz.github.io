I am writing this now sitting at my office desk, using my iPad with a bluetooth keyboard. I haven't even brought my notebook with me today.</p>
<p>Its actually nice not having to lug it around, and of course, among notebooks the MacBook Air is the pick of the crop when it comes to luggable power computing!</p>
<p>Yesterday I caught the train into the city for a couple of appointments, and a visit to the Apple Store. I usually drive, and not only did I get to avoid the 60-90 minute commute and stress levels that come with that, I actually got to do some work. I updated 2 documents and created a third from scratch, checked emails, worked on some spreadsheets and surfed the web a little, <em>all while sitting on the train, and in a coffee shop before/after appointments</em>.</p>
<p>For documents and spreadsheets, the Apple iWork apps of Pages and Numbers, coupled with iCloud, are fantastic. I had a short bus trip before and after one appointment, and it was brilliant to be able to keep working on the same document on the iPhone, as the bus was a bit too crowded and the trip a bit too short to warrant using the iPad.</p>
<p>All this work was done using the on-screen keyboard, as I didn't really want to bring a bluetooth keyboard with me. I've found in the past that in my bag, the keyboard would sometimes be bumped and turn on and thus I'd lose my on-screen keyboard. I decided that I need a better way to carry a keyboard, and so my journey to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/retail/bondi/" title="Apple Store Bondi">Bondi Apple Store</a> resulted in the purchase of the <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/product/H6353ZM/A">Incase Origami Workstation</a> (see photo).</p>
<p>I've only been using the case for 24 hours, and I <em>love</em> it. It makes heavy duty writing much easier.</p>
<p>So my <a href="http://djp.me/ides/" title="iPads of March tag on desparoz.com">iPads of March</a> experiment is going well. I am finding that my productivity on the go is going well, and that there are few things I can't reliably do using the device. The iWork apps are a great foundation, and the Incase case makes life easier. Over the next few posts, I'll talk about further apps that make life easier. I have found a couple of &quot;productivity gaps&quot;, and also plan to cover those.</p>
