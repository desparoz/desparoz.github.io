Whatever way you look at it, Singapore is a colourful city. It boasts a colourful mix of cultures, cuisines and language, and it boasts a rich array of colourful architecture.

With 927 windows in a variety of colours, Singapore’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Hill_Street_Police_Station?wprov=sfti1">Old Hill Street Police Station</a> is a striking landmark as you cruise up the Singapore River from the <a href="www.desparoz.com/2017/01/18/triple-sands-and-double-helix/">Marina Bay</a> towards Clarke Quay.

The building no longer functions as a police station, but its presence, colour and architecture tell a story – a story that is rich with the history of a building that has served as a colonial era police station, a Japanese wartime <em>kempeitai</em> and into the modern era as a government building.
