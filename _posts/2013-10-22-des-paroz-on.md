<p><a href="http://www.desparoz.me/2013/04/09/quick-site-update/">Six months ago I moved DesParoz.com over to SquareSpace</a>, specifically SquareSpace 6. Today I am moving it back to a self-hosted Wordpress installation.</p>

<p>I really like SquareSpace, and continue to run 3 important sites <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> on SquareSpace, and continually heartily recommend SquareSpace as a great option for businesses and organisations who need a fully featured website. But for a site that is primarily a blog, such as DesParoz.com, I was frustrated with the process for publishing an article.</p>

<p>With Wordpress, I can write and publish directly from Byword - both <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Byword for iOS</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Byword for Mac</a>. On SquareSpace, I would have to write in the editor, then copy the HTML, then paste it into the SquareSpace website (or app). It was simply too many steps for my liking.</p>

<p>Frictionless workflows are important, so after considering this change for a while I made the decision to switch back. Frankly my life is likely to be even more <em>on the go</em> in the forseeable future. The ability to write and post <em>on the go</em> is critical. So while I lose some of the powerful features of SquareSpace, I gain the flexibility of Wordpress and Byword.</p>

<p>My workflows are based on the front-end apps I choose to use on a daily basis. Backend systems, whilst important, should be chosen based on how well they support workflows and apps.</p>
