<p>Today's photo of the day was made at Billy Ghizo Point, near Uepi Island in September 2009. </p>
<p> This image features the gorgeous little nudibranch, Hypselodoris bullocki, with its soft body, vivid rhinopores and gills, eating something. The mouth is clearly extended.</p>
<p> In underwater photography, our biggest challenge is that water ruins photos. We need to get as close as possible to our subjects to reduce the water column, so we tend to use wide angle and macro photography (like this one).</p>
<p> Little creatures are often in nooks and crannies. I don't like to move this to make a better photo, so live with the fact that sometimes I get a bit of shadowing or distraction in the foreground or background.</p>
