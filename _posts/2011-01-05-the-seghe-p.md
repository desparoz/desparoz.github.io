<p>Just off the end of the runway of the Seghe airstrip in Marovo Lagoon (near Uepi) there is a P38 lying in about 10m of water.</p>
<p>Following a day trip to dive Penguin Reef and the Babata Sinkhole, we made a short stop at Seghe to dive the wreck.</p>
<p>Although in the middle of the lagoon, the water is still quite clear but with some sediment. I felt that the combination of the silhouette of our dive boat in the surface, the spookiness of a wreck and the sediemnt, this image lent itself to black and white, and this is what I ended up with.</p>
