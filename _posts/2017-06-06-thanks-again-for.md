Thanks again for this great little plug-in. It certainly provides an interesting way to credit those people who are actively interacting.

On <a href="http://desparoz.com/directory">my implementation</a> I notice that anyone who replies to a post via the  micro.blog interface will show by name, but the link will only be to micro.blog - not to their profile, or their blog.

Is this a limitation of the way things are at the moment, or do I need to configure things differently?
