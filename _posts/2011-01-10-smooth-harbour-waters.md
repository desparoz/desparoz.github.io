<p>View from Mrs Macquarie's Chair in Sydney, overlooking the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House at Dusk.</p>
<p>Sydney is an incredibly stunning city, particularly at dusk, and I personally feel that the harbour is a large part of its magnificence.</p>
<p>The harbour is the home of the CBD, and provides several world famous landmarks, such as the bridge and the Opera House. Sydney Harbour is also a transport mechanism for many commuters, a home to defence infrastructure, a route for trade and commerce and a place of recreation (boating, fishing and even diving).</p>
