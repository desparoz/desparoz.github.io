<p>Sunrise at Mahon Pool, near Maroubra in Sydney&#8217;s east.</p>

<p>The chain fence around the pool was the key feature for this image, and I used it to form the basis for the composition. The chain fence is a leading line through the photo, and the key linking featureâ€”the link between the pool and the ocean, the link between night and day (sunrise), etc.</p>

<p>The &#8216;golden hour&#8217; before sunrise is generally a magic time for photography. A site like Mahon Pool is magic on a slightly cloudy day at sunrise, with the intense redness being reflected into both the sea and the pool.</p>

<p>Not only is Mahon Pool a great spot for sunrise photography, it is also one of Sydney&#8217;s best shore dive spots, but only in a calm sea, due to the rather exposed entry and exit point.</p>
