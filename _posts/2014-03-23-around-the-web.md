<p>These are my Around the Web links for March 21st through March 24th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tabletproductive.com/officeipad/">Microsoft Office on the iPad, Really?</a> - Personally I am not a fan of Microsoft Office, and for several years did not use it on my own computers. I use it in a limited way now due to professional/academic requirements, and those of some consulting customers I work with. In particular some templates and macros just require it.

I prefer Markdown for writing and Keynote for presenting.

But I probably will load up Office on the iPad. Especially if it supports templates.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/-357l1.html">Two computer screens aren't better than one</a> - Personally I never really found that having 2 (or more) screens was good for productivity. If anything it causes distraction and confusion.

I&#039;m more a fan of a single screen with apps in full-screen mode. I can easily swipe to other apps if needed, and have various automations setup to allow quick access to apps I regularly need&mdash;such as Calendar (Fantastical), Contacts, etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://groundsroasters.com/">Home | the groundsthe grounds</a> - Had a great lunch at The Grounds at Alexandria. This venue is not just a restaurant or coffee shop. Its a true experience&mdash;a must do for Sydney-siders and those visiting!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/command-c-updated-with-clipboard-history-mac-to-mac-sharing-connection-improvements/">Command-C Updated with Clipboard History, Mac to Mac Sharing, Connection Improvements</a> - </li>
<li><a href="http://www.acer.com.au/ac/en/AU/content/acercloud-application">Acer | Application</a> - AcerCloud looks like a cloud service with the architecture of BitTorrent Sync combined with some of the features of DropBox, Google Drive, etc</li>

</ul>
