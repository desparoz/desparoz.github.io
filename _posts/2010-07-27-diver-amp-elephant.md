<p>At Tawali in PNG's Milne Bay Province, some of the dive sites featured some huge coral.</p>
<p> These elephant ear corals were so huge that I wanted to put a diver in the picture just to give a sense of scale. Of course the wide angle lens I was using (10.5mm fisheye) does exagerate that a little, but nonetheless it was a huge coral.</p>
<p> The clear blue water provided a nice negative spave.</p>
