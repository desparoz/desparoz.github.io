It is always amazing to discover the photographic opportunities that lay waiting in your home area.

Living in the Sutherland Shire, I often drive straight down the Princes Highway when getting up early for sunrise photos, yet one beautiful opportunity is a private jetty in nearby Sylvania Waters.

The jetty is under a private lease and is private property, but the beach is public access, so I tend to wander down to the beach and shoot from the the sand immediately adjacent to the jetty.

This image has been created with a touch of blur added in MacPhun&#8217;s excellent &#8216;<a href="http://macphun.com/focus">Focus Pro</a>&#8217; app, which I use as an add in in Aperture (still).
