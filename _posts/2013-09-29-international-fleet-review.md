<p>This coming Friday, 4th October, marks the <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au/ifr/history/1913-fleet-entry">100th anniversary of the arrival into Sydney of the first dedicated fleet</a> for the <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN) <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. The RAN was actually the first of the former Colonial Dominion navies to become independent of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>To celebrate this milestone, the Royal Australian Navy is conducting an <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au/ifr/">International Fleet Review</a> this week. Thursday (3 Oct) will see an entry by a fleet of around 16 local and international tall ships, whilst Friday (4 Oct) will see the <em>Ceremonial Fleet Entry</em> of around 40 warships - including <a href="http://www.navy.gov.au/ifr/participants/warships">19 Australian and 18 international vessels</a> <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>. This should be a spectacular affair.</p>

<p>On Saturday (5 Oct) the Governor General, joined by HRH Prince Harry, will conduct the <em>Ceremonial Fleet Review</em>. This will be followed by a Spectacular event, and then ships open days on the Sunday and Monday.</p>

<p>In the following days, there will be a number of events around Sydney, including Freedom of Entry parades in Parramatta (HMAS <em>Parramatta</em>&#8217;s crew) and Mosman (HMAS <em>Penguin</em>) and a Combined Navies Parade along George Street, Sydney.</p>

<p>This should be a spectacular week in and around Sydney. There will be marvelous photo opportunities around the harbour and at the various parades and events. It is also a great way to celebrate a milestone for our Royal Australian Navy, and the men and women who serve and have served.</p>

<p>The RAN was actually formed in 1911 using the various vessels of the former Colonial navies, but 1913 marks the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the dedicated fleet. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately the international participation is slightly reduced from the original plans due to Russia re-tasking its vessels to the Mediterranean, and the Canadian participant suffering a mishap en-route to the Pacific. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
