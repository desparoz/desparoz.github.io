<p>Following the <a href="/blog/2013/03/03/evernotes-password-hack-and-the-security-of-your-stuff-in-the-cloud">attempted security hack on Evernote</a>, I determined that I would:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use only reputable services that provide 2-factor authentication for cloud storage of personal, sensitive or confidential data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With more and more services like App.net and Apple joining Google, Dropbox and Facebook in enabling 2 factor support, I thought it would be cool to have a list of the <a href="/2-factor-support">online services that support 2 factor authentication security</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you find updates or note any missing services.</p>
