<em>A thought in reply to: <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://colinwalker.blog/2017/06/15/15062017-0843/">15/06/2017, 08:43</a>...</em>

My feed is more all-in-one. I have a separate feed for the micro posts, although that is superfluous if people follow on <a href="http://micro.blog/desparoz">micro.blog</a>.

I have to give some thought as to whether to have a separate feed for long form posts, but so far haven't seen the need.
