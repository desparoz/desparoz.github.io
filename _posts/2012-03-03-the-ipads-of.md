<p>I've had an iPad, and an iPad 2 since the day each was launched in Australia. My iPads have been fantastic tools for me around home, and on the road. But they've to date been secondary devices, with my MacBook Air or iMac being my primary computing devices.</p>

<p>With the steadily increasing number of apps taking advantage of the more powerful features of iPad, and more recently iCloud, it has been becoming more apparent to me that iPad has a very real potential to be a main device away from base. I can see a not-to-distant future where my computing needs will be served by a powerful machine such as an iMac, along with my iPad and iPhone while away from home.</p>
<p>I want to see how close this "reality" is. So a couple of weeks ago I decided that for a month I would use my iPad exclusively when away from office/home for a month (aside from my iPhone of course), and as the preferred device at home/office.</p>
<p>So, for me March is the month I immerse myself with iPad as my main computing device.</p>
<p>My business and pasttime activities are varied, and I use technology extensively across all of them. I teach <a href="http://divingidc.com" target="_self" title="">scuba and first aid instructor courses</a>, consult to businesses in and out of the recreational dive industry, teach <a href="http://kengokan.com" target="_self" title="">karate</a>, run a small business and am a partner in a business that is developing some apps. I am also president of the <a href="http://www.shorinjiryu.au" target="_self" title="">Australian Shorinjiryu Karatedo Association</a>. In these roles, I give preparations to various sized groups, write reports, conduct research, edit photos and videos, watch videos and so forth. I am also in the process of writing 2 books.</p>
<p>I plan to blog regularly about my experiences in this, the iPads of March. I will cover successes, challenges and things where iPad falls down as. Primary computing device. Please follow this blog to stay up to date with my experiences.</p>
