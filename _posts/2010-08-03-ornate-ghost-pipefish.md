<p>After my first visit to Uepi back in 1997, I always throught of it as a destination for big stuff - mantas, sharks, walls, gorgonians, and so forth. But on our return in 2009, I was blown away by the quantity and variety of small life.</p>
<p> We'd heard rumours of ghost pipefish, but we were literally on the safety stop of our last dive, at a site called North Log, when I found this ornate ghost pipefish living in a crevice on the wall at around 4m.</p>
<p> These little creatures are delicate, and truly ornate, and I was very lucky to have been using the macro lens that captured the tiny details so well.</p>
<p> The big stuff is mind blowing, but the small stuff really makes you appreciate the diversity of life in the oceans.</p>
