I really like this take on why mirrorless is a better option, <em>at least for the photographer in question</em>.

Interesting that the photographer, James Popsys, believes that he takes better photos with mirrorless, mainly due to be inspired to take photos more often.

I tend to agree. I went through a similar journey, and have been all in on mirrorless for a few years now.
