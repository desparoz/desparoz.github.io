We’ve watched the trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a> series today. It looks awesome and I am really looking forward to 25 September…

Like the <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2017/07/18/8987/">upcoming <em>Dr Who</em></a> series, it will be interesting to see a sci-fi show that showcases diversity. Star Trek has always done thing, but there are several strong female characters in the series, and the series incorporates the first openly gay characters.

I also like that non-American actors are retaining their native accents (such as Michelle Yeoh who proudly speaks with her native Malaysian English accent).

The story line looks intriguing with early interaction between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.

Effects look good. Great actually.

So, strong characters, great effects and a promising story line.

All the elements for a good series.
