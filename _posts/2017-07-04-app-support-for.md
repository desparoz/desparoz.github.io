Its been some two years since Apple announced iOS 9, complete with iPad split screen and other multitasking functionality.

My iPads Pro are a key part of my writing, productivity and increasingly, photography, workflow. This is even more the case since the announcement of iOS 11, and all the incredible new iPad Pro centric enhancements.

Most of the apps I use on a daily basis to support my workflows have embraced and support iOS multitasking, including the split screen functionality. These apps include:

<ul>
    <li>Bear</li>
    <li>Byword</li>
    <li>Draftsd</li>
    <li>iBooks</li>
    <li>Lightroom</li>
    <li>Medium</li>
    <li>Micro.blog<a id="fnref-1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-1">[1]</a></li>
    <li>OmniFocus<a id="fnref-2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-2">[2]</a></li>
    <li>ProtonMail</li>
    <li>Reeder</li>
    <li>Slack</li>
    <li>Spark Mail<a id="fnref-3" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-3">[3]</a></li>
    <li>The Photographers Ephemeris</li>
    <li>Timepage</li>
    <li>Tweetbot</li>
    <li>Ulysses</li>
    <li>V for Wikipedia</li>
    <li>500px</li>
</ul>

The list of apps that have refused to provide support for iPad Pro users is, fortunately, much shorter.

<ul>
    <li>Affinity Photo</li>
    <li>Flickr</li>
    <li>Kindle</li>
    <li>Pocket</li>
</ul>

I can kind of forgive Affinity as its quite a new app, and in the photography editing space which kind of develops a whole screen mentality.

But Kindle and Pocket are core reading/research/writing workflow apps. To be core to these types of workflows, the apps need to support iPad Pro type functionality.

<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/07/02/amazon-too-big">Kindle holds a near monopoly</a>, but Pocket has competition. I can’t help but wonder whats holding them back.

Doing this personal analysis of the core apps in my workflows it is pretty pleasing to see that most apps are well positioned to support the growing importance of iPad in a mobile lifestyle. And it is pretty telling to me that at some point I will need to make a call about apps that don’t support my workflows…
