<p><a href="http://thomashawk.com/2014/11/ello-my-new-favorite-social-network.htmlz">Thomas Hawk</a> on his movement from Facebook to <a href="http://ello.co">ello</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been increasingly disappointed with my experience on Facebook. I find that fewer and fewer of my friends are seeing what I post and engagement is increasingly going down.</p>

<p>I’m seeing more and more “sponsored” posts and advertising crowding out organic content, which probably plays a part in this…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have danced with completely deleting my Facebook account for quite some time. There are a few reasons why I haven&#8217;t done so yet, but I view content there occasionally and post content there rarely. When I do post to Facebook its generally reposting from a blog post, or cross posting from <a href="http://instagram.com/desparoz">my Instagram feed</a>.</p>

<p>Again, Thomas Hawk nails it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel respect for my content on Ello, which is shown large in full high res glory. This is why I put more of myself into my art and photography on Ello than any other site. The respect feels greater. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am playing with ello too (find me at <a href="http://ello.co/desparoz">ello.co/desparoz</a> and will certainly try out posting some images and words there to see what feedback I can get.</p>

<p>For me, for now, <a href="http://desparoz.com">DesParoz.com</a> remains my main venue to posting content (images and words), but some social media will continue to play part of communicating that – and will be an increasingly important part of the conversation that continues after the post. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>I have lots of questions about the future of Ello, but at this time Ello is seriously interesting.</p>

<p>While comments are <em>currently</em> still enabled on DesParoz.com, I prefer the conversation to happen elsewhere – such as on the commenters own site, linked back, or perhaps now on Ello. I like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/whats_fair">John Gruber&#8217;s approach</a> of keeping the site clean, an approach that sites like <a href="http://recode.net/2014/11/20/a-note-to-recode-readers/">Re/code</a> are now following. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
