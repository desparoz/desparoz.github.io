<p><img height="428" alt="Red On Blue. Photo by Des Paroz" width="640" src="http://j.mp/VkHXoV" />
One of the beautiful flowers growing around the gardens of <a href="http://www.uepi.com/">Uepi Island Resort</a>, located in the remote and spectacular Marovo Lagoon in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>I loved the colours of the flowering bushes, with the saturated reds and greens, and the blue sky really enhanced the overall scene. Just a touch of HDR has been applied to give the image just a bit more pop.</p>
