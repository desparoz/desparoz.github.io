<p>Cronulla Pool at Sunrise</p>

<p>The pools around the beaches on the NSW coastline are stunning locations for photography—especially with the east coast sunrise.</p>

<p>There are dozens of these pools along the Sydney coast, with several picturesque ones at the southern suburb of Cronulla.</p>

<p>This image was made in April 2014 and really brought out the sunrise colours, and the contrast of the smooth waters in the pool with those of the ocean.</p>

<p>This was one of the first sunrise expedition with my Panasonic Lumix GX&#8211;7, with the one lens I am currently using—the 20mm non-zoom. I decided to learn the camera first before jumping into a variety of zooms.</p>
