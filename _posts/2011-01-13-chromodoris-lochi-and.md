<p>This image was made at North Log, one of the brilliant dive sites near Uepi in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>The nudibranch is Chromodoris lochi, a reasonably common nudibranch in tropical Indo Pacific waters.</p>
<p>I liked the side on profile of this individual, and the blurred background really sharpens the nudibranch.</p>
<p>On processing this image, I was delighted to find an even smaller subject riding the back of the nudi.</p>
