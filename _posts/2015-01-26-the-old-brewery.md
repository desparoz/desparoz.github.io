The Southern Highland&#8217;s town of Mittagong is the home of the Old Tooth&#8217;s Brewery, a location that is full of magical photo opportunities.

Run down and sporting a lot of graffiti, the Old Brewery is a wonderful photographic subject, but should be entered with caution due to the dilapidated state of the buildings and the presence of asbestos on the grounds.

The day we visited we were greeted by the sounds of drum solos from the building, and it turns out a drummer was being filmed and photographed in performance. Made for a bizarre setting.
