<p>Have you ever been waiting in a queue for service for some time, only to have to wait a bit longer because the assistant stops to take a phone call? When I've experienced this I've often been frustrated, and I think this is because I wonder why the person on the phone gets priority over those waiting in person.</p>

<p>Following a link from John Gruber I saw this article at Vanity Fair about the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/my-phone/2013/03/dave-morin-path-facebook-apple?currentPage=all">iPhone of Dave Morin</a>, the founder of <a href="https://path.com/">Path</a>.</p>

<p>When asked about his ring tone, Morin replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I donâ€™t use a ring of any kind on my phone. This is so that I am always on offense and never defense</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I gather that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/29/dave-morin">Gruber was not impressed with Morin's opinion</a>. Personally I thought that the statement about always being on offense was a bit dicky. It kind of felt like he tries to always be offensive....</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/JVeW+" align="right">With that said, <strong>I keep my iPhone in the silent mode 95%+ of the time</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the key things in personal productivity is managing interuptions. <em>In many respects, we live in an attention deficit society. Mobile phones ring, email alerts pop and alerts twirp incessantly</em>. And we all tend to allow ourselves to be interupted.</p>

<p>When I present, conduct training, chair a meeting or act as an MC, I ask people to put their phones in silent mode or turn them off altogether. Sometimes I joke that I offer a half day training course in how to do this. Or a week long residenetial off-site course for managers and executives...</p>

<p>The "interuptitis" epidemic is a key barrier to real productivity in the 21st century. One popular suggestion is, as described by Leo Babuata of Zen Habits, to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://zenhabits.net/focus/">Turn off all notifications. Trying to focus while something is notifying you of an incoming email or tweet or Facebook update is impossible.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this applies just as much to the phone as it does to other notifications.</p>

<p>When I advocate this, people ask what happens if I miss a call. There are three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the caller leaves a message (with a clear, relevant purpose that has value to me), I'll call back;</li>
<li>If they don't leave a message, then they will probably call back; or,</li>
<li>If they don't leave a message and they don't call back, it probably wasn't important.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although my phone is on silent I do leave the vibrate function on. As my phone sits near me on my desk, I hear it vibrate if I am close enough. If I don't hear it, or if I am focused on something else, then the above three options kick in.</p>

<p>When I am on-the-go, my phone is generally in my pocket. I'll feel the vibrations, and will take the call if I am in a position to do so. When I am presenting or conducting training the phone is usually in <em>Airplane mode</em> to avoid interuptions altogether.</p>

<p>Now I occasionally I do switch the silent mode off. That's generally reserved for when I am expecting an important call. If I am with other people, I explain this up front, if possible, and I will leave the room or the immediate area if the call comes in. For the sake of the other people, and the important call coming in, I will quickly silence any calls from other parties.</p>

<p>Phones, email, text messaging, RSS feeds and social media are all tools that <em>can</em> be important parts of our productivity setup. And they can all very easily become <a href="http://djp.me/timesink/">time sinks</a>, or what I  call <em>productivity sink holes</em>. Use notifications, ring tones and alerts wisely, and never be afraid to turn them off.</p>
