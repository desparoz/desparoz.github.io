<p><img height="383" alt="My iPad main screen" width="300" class src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/b23e112283.jpg" />In March 2012 I decided to go for a month using my iPad as my primary on-the-go device - a month I called <a href="http://djp.me/ides/"><em>iPads of March</em></a>. My iMac in my home/office continued to be my "heavy-lifting" device for processing images/videos, building presentations, text formatting  for some manuscripts I was working on and for accounting activities for my business. But I used the iPad for pretty much everything else - including researching, writing, email, task management, presentations, etc.</p>
<p>I wanted to test the idea that iPad is approaching the point when it could be a primary on-the-go device for a power-user like me. <em>For content production as well as consumption</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, where iPad leads others follow, so I know that when iPad reaches that point, we consumers will have a range of iOS, Android, Windows and other devices to help us do our work and live our lives.</p>
<p>I chose March last year for a couple of reasons - it was the month that the <a href="/blog/2012/03/09/new-ipad-launch-and-my-predictions">3rd generation iPad</a> was to be launched, but it was also a month in which I had no <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">scuba instructor courses</a> scheduled, as these courses are intensive on my workflows and technology (multimedia rich presentations and lots and lots of paperwork).</p>
<p>My findings were interesting. I found that my iPad could <em>easily</em> handle 90% of my on-the-go work that my MacBook Air would normally perform. In fact, there were three main things that were missing that would be a show-stopper for using the iPad as my primary device.</p>
<ol>
<li>Multimedia presentations using Keynote were (and continue to be) awkward and crappy. Many of my Keynote presentations have embedded media, and getting these into Keynote for iOS is cumbersome and results in significant quality reduction of the videos.</li>
<li>Document scanning to PDF is pretty awful. I don't mean low volume stuff using the iPad camera, but piles of multipage documents. I need to keep records of lots of paperwork, and to date I have not found a workable solution that approaches my <a href="http://www.neat.com/products/neatreceipts">NeatReceipts</a> scanner for scanning out and about. When I am in town, I can do my scanning at home on my trusty Fujitsu ScanSnap 1500M.</li>
<li>Business accounting software. My accountant wants me to use MYOB. I have the FirstEdge software for OSX, and there is no iOS application support.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2013, things are changing. While Keynote has not improved media handling as yet, there are other web/app based solutions that I am exploring. For scanning, the introduction of the iOS capabilities into the <a href="http://scanners.fcpa.fujitsu.com/scansnap11/iX500.html">Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500</a> suggests that future versions of their mobile scanners will do the same. For financial accounting, I might upgrade to a package that would allow mobile integration. Or just live with the fact that I do my finances only from the home office.</p>
<p>March 2013 presents itself as another month with no scheduled courses that require rich multimedia, though I have some other courses/presentations that will allow me to test some concepts. My MacBook Air is in with the Genius Bar folks for repair, so it seems to me that I have once again the opportunity to use the iPad as my main on-the-go device. I am going to focus on making presentations work on the iPad, as scanning is on the horizon.</p>
<p>I'll make two quick predictions and see how they turn out.</p>
<ol>
<li>The iPad will have made giant strides, and will be close the gap on becoming my primary on-the-go device</li>
<li>There will be <a href="/blog/2012/12/24/new-ipad-in-march-predictions"><strong>no new iPad launched in March</strong></a></li>
</ol>
