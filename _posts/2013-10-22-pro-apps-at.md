<p>There is as expected a lot of noise going around about tomorrow&#8217;s Apple event. </p>

<p>Of course there will be new a new iPad - probably both a full size and an iPad mini with Retina. Theres likely to be new MacBooks and I think the long awaited MacPro is bound to get a mention. </p>

<p>OSX Mavericks will also be released. </p>

<p>Personally I am also interested in the app side of things. Updates to iWork for Mac are long overdue and much needed. Rumours have been circulating regarding iLife apps - particularly GarageBand. </p>

<p>But how about Pro apps. You know, to go with the new Mac<em>Pro</em> and the (new) MacBook <em>Pro</em> modelsâ€¦</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;re likely to see a new release of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/aperture/id408981426?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Aperture</a> <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and perhaps some surprises. </p>
