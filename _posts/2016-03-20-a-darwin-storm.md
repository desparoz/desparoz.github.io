A Darwin Storm

So we've been living in Darwin for about six months now, and are coming to the end of our first wet season. It has, apparently, been one of the least wet wet seasons on record, but there have still been some pretty interesting storms come through.

Here's a timelapse video of a storm as seen from our balcony this evening.
