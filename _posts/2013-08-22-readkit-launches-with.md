<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/sNFd+" align="right"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/readkit/id588726889?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">ReadKit</a> <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> has become my favourite desktop app for reading my RSS feeds, and reading and managing articles I save for later reading and/or sharing. ReadKit sports a clean, intuitive user experience, and supports a wide range of feed, read-later and sharing services, including Feed Wrangler, <a href="http://desparoz.com/blog/2013/4/18/state-of-play-fever-rss-and-apps">Fever</a>, Feedbin, Feedly, NewsBlur, Pocket, Instapaper, Readability, Pinboard and Delicious. </p>

<p>I first started using ReadKit as a clean desktop app for both Instapaper and Fever. In the case of the latter, it was an interim solution until the long-awaited Reeder for OSX update which promises to support Fever and more. </p>

<p>Today the <a href="http://webinhq.com/">Webin</a> team have released version 2.3, and along with a snappy new icon, it now supports a feature that I&#8217;ve long wanted - a one click ability to move an item from a web feed (such as <a href="http://feedwrangler.net">Feed Wrangler</a> or Fever) to a bookmarking service such as <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> or Delicious.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/readkit/post/5225663">I requested this very feature</a> via an App.net conversation with the ReadKit team back in May, with the following post</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@readkit In v2 beta, is it (or would it be) possible to have a single click to create a bookmark from a Fever post, bringing up the dialogue box to save to Pocket/Instapaper/Pinboard, etc? Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within minutes, they came back with this reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@desparoz you can drag the posts between accounts. Just drop it on the unread folder of the read later/bookmark service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My reply indicated I was aware of this, but outlined why I still wanted a one-click process:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@readkit I realise that, but then I have to go to extra steps to bring up the box to type in description, etc. I use IFTTT to pull from Pinboard to App.net &amp; Twitter. So it adds steps to my workflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I loved their response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@desparoz I see. Weâ€™ll solve it soon ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great example of a developer paying attention to the needs and wants of its customers. I&#8217;m hardly the most prolific of bloggers <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> and this simple automation allows me to the quickly share some posts I&#8217;ve found to be important and/or interesting.</p>

<p>The ReadKit team has put a lot of thought into my this process as simple as possible. Clicking on the share buttom brings up a list of choices that now includes Pinboard and Delicious. Selecting Pinboard (in my case) brings up a dialogue box with options to edit the title, tags and description. The title and description information defaults from the article being saved.</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/WUTh+" alt="Simple Pinboard sharing with ReadKit" id="rkss" /></p>

<p>So far this works brilliantly. The only feature request I can see to date is to have an option for selecting whether a post should be private or shared from the dialogue box.</p>

<p>I now use Pocket instead of Instapaper, and Feed Wrangler instead of Fever. Even though Pocket has a beautiful OSX app, the simple integration of these services, and Pinboard, makes ReadKit an absolute winner. I&#8217;m no longer waiting for an update to Reeder for OSX <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using an RSS service, read-later and/or bookmarking services and you&#8217;re a Mac user I strongly suggest you give <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/readkit/id588726889?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">ReadKit</a> a try.</p>

<p>I do try to be more regular, but there is a lot of good stuff going on in my world at the moment. So I&#8217;ve had focus my limited time and attention. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I love <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Reeder for iPhone</a>. On the iPad, I prefer <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky">Mr Reader</a>. These and ReadKit on OSX allow me similar workflows to quickly share items using Pinboard with an <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> recipe to share to App.net, Twitter and LinkedIn.  <a href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
