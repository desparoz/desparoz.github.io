Iâ€™m still experimenting with how I structure my blogging. 

At this stage I am using my main blog, [BalancedLight](https://desparoz.com) to focus on *exploration and story-telling*, and it will be main focal point for photography and writing on these areas.

My Micro.blog, [Micro Thoughts](https://desparoz.me), will continue to serve as a link and photo blog, and will also be where I discuss more general thoughts on life, technology and more.

Always enjoy sharing and discussing.
