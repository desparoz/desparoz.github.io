<p>Just a couple of quick notes about the Des Paroz On The Go website.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Firstly, I&#8217;ve moved the site over to <a href="http://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>. I have been planning to do this for a while, and finally bit the bullet. This is the third site I personally have on Squarespace, plus I manage two others hosted there. It&#8217;s a very integrated service, and the native Markdown support is certainly a bonus. This is my first live site thats on Squarespace6. SS6 certainly provides a lot of additional flexibility and functionality, but does take some getting used to. I am getting to like it a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ve killed the old RSS feeds that were using Feedburner. I&#8217;ve moved away from the free Google offering to a paid offering at <a href="http://uri.lv">uri.lv</a>. Looking good so far. All old feeds should be redirecting seamlessly. Let me know if you get any issues in the comments. </p></li>
<li><p>I am moving my link blog back to a simple Pinboard setup. I have the latest 5 links in the sidebar here, or you can visit <a href="http://djp.me/pinboard/">Des Paroz on Pinboard</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, just some housekeeping, but hope it&#8217;s of interest.</p>
