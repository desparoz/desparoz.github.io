<p>These are my Around the Web links for April 1st through April 10th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2014/04/deckset/">&infin; Deckset</a> - a great review by Ben Brooks on Deckset. I&#039;ve already created and delivered a preso with Deckset and found it *super* easy. I&#039;m planning my own review</li>
<li><a href="http://tracking.feedpress.it/link/1176/51771">Dropbox Announces That Mailbox Is Coming To OS X</a> - interesting!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2014/04/tips-for-getting-the-most-out-of-fantastical-for-ipad.html">Tips for Getting the Most Out of Fantastical for iPad</a> - I&#039;m liking Fantastical 2 for iPad, and Gabe&#039;s tips are helpful in getting under the hood.</li>
<li><a href="http://presentationmagic.com/2014/04/03/alphares/">And the Apple love for Keynote and its users keeps coming&hellip;</a> - Pleased to see a positive view of the latest updates to iWork from a power use of the apps&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/ifttt-for-ios-gets-ipad-app-curated-collections-and-native-notifications/">IFTTT for iOS Gets iPad App, Curated Collections, and Native Notifications</a> - IFTTT is an important part of my automation toolset and I pleased to see its iPad debut&hellip;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2138687/latest-iwork-update-is-another-win-for-applescript.html">More On The AppleScript Improvements In Latest iWork Update</a> - Apple certainly has an unique approach to app release for major version changes&mdash;strip back to the bare essentials then re-add features but in a new and vastly improved way.

<li><a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/fantastical-2-for-ipad/">Fantastical 2 for iPad</a> - I&#039;ve been really looking forward to this release. Just downloaded it setting it up for me. I suspect it will bcome as big a part of my iPad workflow as Fantastical is on OSX and iPhone. I got a bit of &#039;sticker shock&#039; at the A$12.99 price, but good software has value, and I suspect it will be worth every cent.</li>
