What is Ello?

<a href="https://ello.co">Ello</a> founder <a href="https://ello.co/budnitz">Paul Budnitz</a> provides a beautiful description of <a href="https://ello.co/budnitz/post/Y6wxmcyQsfXIgv5VmJIHFA">what Ello is</a> â€“ why it is not Facebook. Or any other social network. It is simply Ello.

I like Ello for its simplicity and the fact that it is genuinely focused on providing a creative outlet. The lack of &#8216;Likes&#8217; and &#8216;+1s&#8217; means that people give actual feedback (comments) or nothing at all. And the actual comments are more likely to be balanced.

If you want creative feedbck, give Ello a go. Let me know if you need an invitation.
