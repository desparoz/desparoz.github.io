<p>CEO of Omni Group, Ken Case announced the Debut of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/entry/debut-of-omnifocus-2">OmniFocus 2</a> (at Macworld/iWorld):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…our goals for version 2 are to bring back to the Mac all of the design and innovation that went into our iPad edition of OmniFocus: dedicated Forecast and Review modes, clearer navigation, and a fresh look and feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a long-time practitioner of what is a personal evolution of David Allen’s <a href="http://djp.me/gtd/">Getting Things Done</a> approach, I’ve used a variety of organisational tools on a variety of platforms - OSX, iOS, Windows, PalmOS, etc. These have included native and third party apps. OmniFocus on OSX and iOS remains my pick due to its all around power. I love the fact that the Omni people have uncovered a very clever workaround to get OmniFocus to work with <a href="/blog/2011/10/17/iphone-4s-siri-and-the-future">Siri</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of people however find OmniFocus to be a complex app, particularly on the Mac (OSX). As Katie Floyd mentioned in her post about the <a href="http://katiefloyd.me/blog/macworldiworld-omnifocus-2-debut">announcement of OmniFocus 2</a>, there is the perception amoung some users that you need a “degree in OmniFocus”!</p>
<p><img id="ipad" src="http://j.mp/Tnqvyl" alt="OmniFocus for iPad" align="right" />By contrast, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-ipad/">OmniFocus for iPad</a> sports a brilliant UI, and is actually where I do most of my process and review activities. I use the OSX and iPhone versions of the app to capture and also to check off next actions completed. The iPad version has a special “review mode” that takes you through a review of Projects that have had the appropriate attention recently. This powerful function will be a feature of OmniFocus 2.</p>
<p>The other factor that has made OmniFocus less approachable to the average user was its pricing. In his post he also outlines a new pricing approach, which will see a standard version available at US$39.99 - still a high end app, but half the price of the current version. There will be a Pro Version with support for custom workflows. There will also be special pricing for users of the current version of OmniFocus on OSX, available through the Omni Group’s website.</p>
<p>OmniFocus <em>is</em> a high end, quality app. With the new UI in OSX, and with its new pricing model, it will continue to be <em>the</em> first choice for productivity power users, and will be an excellent choice for less full-on productivity enthusiasts. Availability has yet to be announced, and it will go into private testing shortly.</p>
