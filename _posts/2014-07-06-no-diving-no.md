<p>Sunrise at Mahon Pool, near Maroubra in Sydney&#8217;s east.</p>

<p>On a morning with sunrise potential, there are often photographers out at Mahon Pool. Most are shooting the sun rising over the pool or the nearby rocks. After the sun has risen, most pack up and go, but it is worth hanging around for and look at what the sun is doing on the interesting rock formations on the nearby coastline.</p>

<p>I was quite taken with these stairs to nowhere - clearly a relic of some bygone era. The current stairs are in the background, but these were quite interesting in how they just stop.</p>

<p>Not only is Mahon Pool a great spot for sunrise photography, it is also one of Sydney&#8217;s best shore dive spots, but only in a calm sea, due to the rather exposed entry and exit point.</p>
