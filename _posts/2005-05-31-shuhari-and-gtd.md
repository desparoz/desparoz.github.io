<p>This blog post is a bit of a re-write of a comment I made to the post <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050623191030/http://www.43folders.com/2005/05/fractal_impleme.html"><em>Fractal Implementation, or, On the Dangers of David Allen's Finger</em></a> over on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann's 43 Folders</a> site.</p>
<p>Its a funny thing, but I think that there is a mindset that its <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050623191030/http://desparoz.typepad.com/onthego/2005/05/methodology_tec.html">easier to play with a system than to just do the stuff the system is prescribing</a>.</p>
<p>Playing and experimentation is in itself a good thing - a very good thing. But it needs a time and place, and that time and place is when you've really bedded down the methodology, and are using it well.</p>
<p>Next Actions, Weekly Reviews, Waiting Fors and leakless collection habits are all things that need to be second nature before you've <em>earned the right</em> to tweak.</p>
<p>At the risk of using another martial arts metaphor, in karate there is a concept of learning called <strong>Shu-Ha-Ri.</strong></p>
<p>The first stage, <strong>Shu,</strong> basically entails rote learning, without asking questions. Things should be done the way that has been shown, and absolutely following both the methods and the principles.</p>
<p>The second stage, <strong>Ha,</strong> involves personalising the system. In this stage, it is acceptable (within limits) to modify the methods <em>without changing the core principles</em> to suit your individual strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; Having explored the Shu stage in depth, you should be keenly aware of your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The third stage, <strong>Ri,</strong> is a natural progression where one develops their own "style within a style", deeply studying the core principles and modifying both the methods and the principles where appropriate to suit one's own process.</p>
<p>In the martial arts, Shu-Ha-Ri has no set timetable. It is observed, not driven. It happens naturally - when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. But in essence, it can take 5 years to move through the Shu stage into Ha, and then another 5 years or more to move through the Ha stage. Incidentally, this means that someone of early black belt level is generaly still in the Shu stage.</p>
<p>I wonder if <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen's</a> metaphor of black belt in his <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">Getting Things Done (GTD)</a> approach<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050623191030/http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php"> </a> is coincidental - maybe his message is that people should learn and internalise the basics before getting too experimental. I am not suggesting that it should take 5 years before we adapt our GTD implementation, but it should take however long is required to internalise the methods and principles, before modifying the methods.</p>
<p>Lets not forget that David Allen has been doing this stuff for 20+ years.&nbsp; In my books he has earned the right to modify methods and principles to develop his own system.</p>
