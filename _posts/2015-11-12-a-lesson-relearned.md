I sometimes wonder how often we have to re-learn a lesson we&#8217;ve previously learned. It can be an especially intriguing conundrum when we make a mistake that not only have we previously learned, but one for which measures have been put in place to minimise associated risks.

Recently I went out for some sunrise photography at Cullen Bay in Darwin, a picturesque bayside suburb with a marina and even a lock to allow the bay and marina to stay. It is a stunning location for sunrise photography, especially with an aspect that features the sun rising over the picturesque marina.

My preferred vantage point for such photos is on the corner of a boardwalk that extends out over the bay. The boardwalk is constructed of wooden boards that have a 3&#8211;5cm gap between them, so I tend to take care when fitting filters, lenses and other accessories to my rig.

In an effort to ensure I have what I need whenever I go for a shoot, and to ensure each piece is secured properly I have a standard way that I stow my gear, firstly in an inner bag, which then goes into a messenger bag or backpack, depending on the shoot. Stowing stuff is important to make sure I can find things quickly, and that it doesn&#8217;t fall out.

This time I took along a spare battery that I took out of the charger, and literally three into a top compartment of my backpack - not in the normal pocket I put batteries in on the insert bag. The top compartment is where I stow things like a flash unit and filter kits<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.

I carefully laid my backpack down on a table, setup my tripod and camera, and decided to add a graduated neutral density filter. With the backpack laid down I opened the top compartment, and straight away the spare battery fell out, bounced onto the boardwalk below, and then straight through a gap and into the water.

So the spare battery, not a cheap accessory, was quickly lost into Cullen Bay.

The lessons learned:

<ol>
<li>Have a set way to stow gear for securing and quick retrieval.</li>
<li>Use it consistently.</li>
</ol>

The lesson could have been more expensive. And it is a cheap lesson if I re-learn it, and apply the lessons consistently.

I am actually looking for a better set up for stowing my filter kits, so will hopefully have a better approach sooner than later. <a href="#fnref-1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a>
