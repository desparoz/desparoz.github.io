<h1>Testing Out Blogging on Blot.im</h1>

I set up a <a href="http://desparoz.blot.im">test blog</a> on <a href="http://blot.im">Blot</a>, which is effectively a Markdown based blogging platform with which you save your posts to a Dropbox folder, and the system does the rest from there.

Its kind of cool for <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> type usage, and the cool thing is it is a true IndieWeb environment as the files sit in your own Dropbox account.

I had previously played around with a similar service (Scriptogr.am), although when that went away<a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> I focused on just my Wordpress blog. I have however moved across all the files from the old Scriptogr.am blog, and that content is live on my site.

Today I set up a combination of a Workflow workflow and a Draft action to simultaneously post new micro-posts created in Drafts to both sites.

I will also take a look and see whether I will push all my Markdown files for longform posts to both sites. For this post, for example, I will publish to the Wordpress blog from Byword, then move the file to the Blot Dropbox folder.

Whats the advantage of doing this?

<ol>
<li>Playing around with a new platform is kinda fun.</li>
<li>Backing up my posts in a reusable format.</li>
<li>Somewhere to redirect people if my Wordpress site goes down.</li>
</ol>

Interesting times.

Looking at the Scriptogr.am website it appears that some new social media app/tool is <em>coming soon</em> to that domain, with a very similar logo. <a href="#fnref-1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a>
