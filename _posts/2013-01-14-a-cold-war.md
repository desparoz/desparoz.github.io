<p><a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/china_rebuffs_australia_us_cold_UzSTlcvhihWAIv9c0iPeoO">In today’s Australian Financial Review: China rebuffs Australia-US ‘Cold War style’ co-operation</a> (paywall).
<blockquote>…China’s ambassador to Australia, Chen Yu­ming, told The Australian Financial Review there was too much emphasis on the strengthening of military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region and not enough on the pressing economic difficulties which meant countries like the US, China, Europe and Japan had to work closely together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</a> finally become a country?</p>
<p>China’s relationships with other countries is clearly a touchy subject. Disputes with Japan over ownership of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands_dispute">Senkaku Islands</a> (known as the Daioyu Islands by the Chinese), and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea">disputes over maritime boundaries in the South China Sea</a> are at least part of the United States’ Pivot to Asia.</p>
<p>But I think it is realistic that the pivot is more about <a href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1106840/military-weakest-link-us-pivot-asia">trade, economics and diplomatic relations</a>.</p>
