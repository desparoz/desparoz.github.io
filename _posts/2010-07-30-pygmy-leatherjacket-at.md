<p>These little fish (Pygmy Leatherjackets) are about the size of a fifty cent coin, and are gemerally quite timid. This one is a juvenile, with more pronounced orange spots.</p>
<p> Their basic defence strategy appears to be to look like some floating seaweed.</p>
<p> Shiprock, in Sydney's south, is a great divesite for small life, and these pygmy leatherjackets are regularly spotted by keen eyed divers.</p>
