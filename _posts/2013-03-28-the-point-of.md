<p>2013 is for me the year where I am completing my transition to a fully paperless life in my business initiatives, and in my personal life. In order to get a picture of what this actually means, I've thought long and hard about the definition of the term "paperless".</p>

<p>I've been intending to post about this thinking process for a while, but was motivated to do so when I saw this quote from <a href="http://scansnapcommunity.com/features/8489-snapfact-friday-pdf-with-a-purpose/">Jordyn Russell of Fujitsu America</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tracking invoices digitally is one of the many benefits of PDF. And yet, we continue to print a large majority of invoices that were once PDF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/9fdc3bc5db.jpg" align="right">Coupled with the fact that <a href="http://www.paperless2013.org/about.php">"the average US office worker uses 10,000 sheets of copy paper each year"</a>, it really is time that we consider just how much paper we actually use, and how much we realistically need to use.</p>

<p>So what does "paperless" mean? Wikipedia states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A paperless office is a work environment in which the use of paper is eliminated or greatly reduced</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eliminated or greatly reduced? Which is it?</p>

<p>Well I think that <em>eliminated</em> (i.e. paperless being "without paper") would be the perfect goal, but the problem with perfection is that it is unattainable.</p>

<p>I think it's far more realistic to set the sites on <em>greatly reduced</em>. In other words, paperless being "less paper". Significantly less. Eliminate it wherever possible. <a href="http://vimeo.com/61275290">Without getting stupid about it...</a></p>

<p>Paper comes into my life all the time - invoices, bank statements and similar items come in by hard copy <em>all the time</em>. Throughout the typical day you collect additional <em>paper-bourne clutter</em> as you go about life. Receipts, business cards, tickets, brochures, etc all end up in little piles in your wallet, car and house.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://macsparky.com/">David Sparks</a> said beautifully in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=520393162"><em>Paperless</em> MacSparky Field Guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We are bombarded with bits of paper and digital information every day. Much of it (too much of it) is trash but some of it is absolutely essential.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Making front-end decisions when processing bits of paper into your life is critical. Having the tools to do so is important. I plan to continue posting from time-to-time on this journey talking about my workflows and tools I use.</p>

<p>What's your view on paperless - do you aim for total elimination of <em>paper-bourne clutter</em> or do you seeks great reduction?</p>
