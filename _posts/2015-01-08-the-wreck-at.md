<h3>Photography Podcasts</h3>

<p>The SS Ayrfield is one of several old shipwrecks around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebush_Bay">Homebush Bay</a> in Sydney&#8217;s west.</p>

<p>As an avid wreck <a href="http://divingidc.com">diver</a> and <a href="http://desparoz.photos/underwater">underwater photographer</a> I have always enjoyed the challenge of trying to get images of shipwrecks. Challenging it is, as trying to get even a small wreck in an image is complex when you need to shoot through what is often gloomy water.</p>

<p>To have the opportunity to capture images of a wreck in its final resting place, while shooting from shore is wonderful, and you can really take your time to make a variety of images.</p>

<p>Built over 100 years ago, the SS Ayrfield was one of the &#8216;60 milers&#8217; – the name given to the numerous colliers that worked between Sydney Harbour and the coalfields of the Illawarra and Hunter regions.</p>

<p>In 1972, the Ayrfield was sent to a ship breaking yard at Homebush, and is one of four wrecks that remain in place.</p>

<p>Homebush Bay was once a hub of Sydney&#8217;s heavy industry, and became a dumping ground for a lot of industrial waste, including the old ship hulls.</p>

<p>Having been cleaned up, Homebush Bay became the home of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, and is now a residential, sporting and entertainment and business district.</p>

<p>The old wrecks remain in place, and are popular sites for photography, particularly with the setting sun.</p>
