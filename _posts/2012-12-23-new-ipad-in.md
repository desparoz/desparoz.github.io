<p>Predictions by the sometimes-spot-on, often-way-off rumour site <a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-18729.html">Macotakara</a> suggest that a new, thinner, lighter <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/12/23/thinner-lighter-5th-generation-ipad-to-arrive-in-march-2013/">5th generation iPad will be released in March</a>.
I'll make an early prediction on this one: "no way". I give it a 20% chance of happening.</p>
<p>Simply, Apple loves releasing new versions of its flagship products about once per year. In the past 2 years they've carefully "reset" the cycle for both iPhone and iPad to coincide with the Christmas buying season.</p>
<p>I'd say we can predict that iPhone and iPad, along with iPod, will continue with a September/October launch cycle.</p>
