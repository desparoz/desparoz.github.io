<p><img src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/ff57618c6c.jpg" align="right" width="400" alt="iOS 6.1 Update Screenshot from Apple.com" />No doubt all serious iPad and iPhone users are busy downloading the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1624?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US">iOS 6.1 Software Update</a>, which has a couple of new features, though nothing outstanding unless youâ€™re in the US, or one of the additional 23 <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/">markets covered by LTE</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LTE support for more carriers</li>
<li>Purchase movie tickets through Fandango with Siri (USA only)</li>
<li>iTunes Match subscribers can now download individual songs from iCloud</li>
<li>New button to reset the Advertising Identifier</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I must admit that I am just as excited by the announcement that <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/01/28/apple-updates-apple-tv-with-up-next-and-bluetooth-keyboard-new-appletv32-model-revealed/">they have updated Apple TV with Up Next and Bluetooth Keyboard</a>. Update features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>iTunes in the Cloud</li>
<li><strong>Bluetooth keyboard</strong>: Use your Apple Wireless Keyboard to control your Apple TV.</li>
<li>AirPlay audio for videos: Send stereo audio from movies, TV shows, and other videos on Apple TV to AirPlay-enabled speakers and devices</li>
<li>Stability and performance</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All of these update items are terrific, but the addition of bluetooth has been a long time coming, and will be quite welcome when searching for particular items. I have also found the Apple TV to be a bit temperamental at times, so am looking forward to the stability and performance updates.</p>
