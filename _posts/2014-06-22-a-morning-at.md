<p>Sydney Harbour is one of the most scenic harbours in the world, at least in part due to some of the world famous landmarks like the Sydney Opera House.</p>

<p>The image was made from Milsons Point using a Nikon 18&#8211;200mm telephoto zoom. Finding the right position was challenging because I had to shoot under the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</p>

<p>With the sun coming up somewhat behind the Opera House, I exposed three images and tone mapped them using HDR. A little bit of sharpening was also applied.</p>

<p>Sydney Harbour is a beautiful waterway, and I enjoy exploring different parts of it for sunrise and sunset.</p>
