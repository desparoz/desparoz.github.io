<p>These are my Around the Web links for March 20th through March 21st:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/prizmo-for-ios/">Prizmo &mdash; Text Scanner and OCR for iOS</a> - I use Genius Scan+ and PDFpen Scan+, but the URL-scheme support for Prizmo sounds interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.agilebits.com/2014/03/19/apps-that-love-1password-unread-fantastical-tonalli/">Apps that Love 1Password: Unread, Fantastical, Tonalli</a> - </li>
<li><a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-use-pinboard/">How I Use Pinboard</a> - Great summary of Pinboard and why you should use it as a bookmarking tool</li>
<li><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/11/01/save-pocket-favorites-to-nvalt-with-ifttt-and-hazel/">Save Pocket favorites to nvALT with IFTTT and Hazel</a> - I love Brett Terpstra&#039;s work in automation. This is a great little approach that hacks together the online automation tool IFTTT with Hazel for your Mac to integrate Pocket and nvALT.</li>
<li><a href="http://tecrec.padi.com/2014/03/19/a-deceptively-easy-way-to-die-update/">A Deceptively Easy Way to Die &ndash; Update by Rosemary Lunn</a> - As a general rule diving is something that should only be undertaken by qualified divers within the limits of their training. As a specific rule, cave diving should never be undertaken by anyone&mdash;certified diver or not&mdash;who is not specifically trained, equippped and prepared to dive in caves. A sad story that should never have to be told.</li>

</ul>
