<p>We've been watching Lost, without missing an ep, since we saw the premiere on a trip to the US. Two eps from the finale, there are still many questions. But the show is excruciatingly rivetting.
I think that Scott Meyer has got it right in his <a href="http://basicinstructions.squarespace.com/basic-instructions/2010/5/19/how-to-discuss-lost.html">latest Basic Instructions comic</a>.</p>

<p>Brilliant!</p>
