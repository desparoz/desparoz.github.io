I've discussed previously about how more and more people are going <em>iPad only</em>, or at least <em>iPad Primary</em>. People like <a href="https://www.macstories.net">Federico Viticci</a> have famously gone iPad only, and educator <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/2015/12/02/fraser-spiers-asks-if-the-macbook-pro-can-substitute-for-an-ipad-pro/">Fraser Spiers wonders if a MacBook Pro can substitute for an iPad Pro</a>.

More and more people are sharing their adventures and epiphanies in going iPad Only, or iPad Primary, and I thought I might share some links to some of those stories…

<strong>Drew Coffman</strong> discusses his thoughts on <a href="http://extratextuals.com/living-with-the-ipad-pro/">Living With the iPad Pro</a>. Clearly Drew has found that the iPad Pro is the ideal computing device for his current needs:

<blockquote>
  The thing that excites me more than anything is that the iPad Pro is such a young platform. Even with its flaws, I'm still enjoying it more than any other computer I've ever used. There's plenty of room for the iPad (and iOS in general) to grow—but I'm no longer using today's technology while dreaming of tomorrow's. I'm more than happy with what exists in the present.
</blockquote>

Meanwhile, <strong>Khoi Vinh</strong> comes to the conclusion that he is<a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2016/02/05/im-done-with-macbooks/">Done with MacBooks</a>, <em>though not with Macs</em>:

<blockquote>
  But now, in contrast to my iPad, my laptop seems altogether much more cumbersome than I prefer to deal with. It’s much, much heavier and bulkier than my iPad, especially when you factor in its power supply and a carrying case.
</blockquote>

He is speaking as a designer who relies on the powerful features available in macOS, yet his conclusion is that the best place for the high-end <em>desktop</em> OS is on his desktop, where he can have a high-end computer...

<blockquote>
  When I think about where I’m most productive with OS X, it’s always at my desk, where I have a huge monitor.
</blockquote>

This makes a lot of sense. No matter how good a notebook computer is, a desktop running the same OS is <em>always</em> going to be more powerful and more flexible.

<strong>Ben Brooks</strong> is another who has a clear view on <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/ios/">Why iOS is Compelling</a>

<blockquote>
  iOS is my everything place now. It’s not only always with me, but it’s always in sync with itself. What’s on my iPad is on my iPhone
</blockquote>

<strong>Justin Blanton</strong> made a prediction on Twitter in 2011 that looks like it might be closer to the truth than fantasy…

In a recent post Justin provides an update on the evolution to <a href="https://anxiousrobot.net/iphone-only-d3edd4ca1543#.6uz9pyp05">iPhone-only</a>

<blockquote>
  nearly all of my professional (and personal) consumption can be done enjoyably from my iPhone or iPad; and almost all of my professional output is channeled through either email or Messenger, also easily handled by my iOS devices.
</blockquote>

Clearly he broadened his thinking to include tablet devices, but he is actually upping the game on his prediction - he now thinks that iPhone 8 will be the tipping point. I like that he talks about the 'enjoyability' factor of using an iPhone or iPad.

###Conclusion

Some of these above are going iPad Only, others are going iPad Primary (especially when mobile), and others are even moving to iPhone centric. The future of on-the-go computing is clearly going to be centred on nimble, portable devices like tablets and smartphones.

Notebook and laptop computers are far from dead, but the real place where a desktop OS like OSX or Windows delivers the greatest power will be on the desktop.
