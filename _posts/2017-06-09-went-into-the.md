Went into the city tonight to take a look at <a href="https://www.vividsydney.com">Vivid Sydney</a> - specifically in the Barangaroo precinct.

It was quite a wet evening, so we didn't stay too long. On the plus side, there weren't many crowds, and some of the installations were really interesting in the wet light.

The <a href="https://www.vividsydney.com/event/light/what-lies-beneath">What Lies Beneath</a> exhibit was pretty cool. As a diver the homage to the ocean world was quite interesting.

Took a couple of images on the iPhone - my main camera is in for repair at the moment. Hopefully it will be back before the end of Vivid so I can get some images.
