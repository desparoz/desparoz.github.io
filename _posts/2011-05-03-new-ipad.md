<p>A couple of weeks ago I bit the bullet and decided to order a new iPad 2.
Advertised as shipping in 1-2 weeks on the Apple website, it arrived in 10 days, shipped from China.</p>
<p>I got the 64GB 3G model in whiten with the red leather smart cover.</p>
<p>I can see what <a href="http://www.twit.tv">Leo Laporte</a> and others have been saying- the white unit does look smaller than the black. When you place it next to a black unit, the screen is identical in size.</p>
<p>The iPad 2 is certainly noticeably lighter and appreciably smaller than the older unit. It's also faster.</p>
<p>Haven't really played around with the other new features (cameras, gyro, etc) yet, but looking forward to playing.</p>
<p>So far really impressed with the new iPad 2.</p>
