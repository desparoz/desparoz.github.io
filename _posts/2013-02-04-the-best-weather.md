<p>There is no shortage of Weather apps available on iPhone, but few do the job in elegant way, particularly for those of us who are outside the US.
Most of the international weather services do a reasonable job of Australian forecasts and data, but few seem to have the consistency and accuracy of the Australian government’s <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/index.shtml">Bureau of Meteorology</a>. Those few apps that use data from BOM too often have a cluttered format.</p>
<p>Apple’s own (pre-loaded) weather app pulls data from Yahoo! weather, and has the main advantage of Siri integration. But the big disadvantage is that the weather data it pulls is descriptive at best, and never detailed enough for me. It also differs from BOM. For example, the forecast for tomorrow in Sydney (6 Feb 2013) from BOM shows a temperature range of 19–26C, whilst Yahoo shows 19–25C.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The man with one watch knows what time it is. The man with two is never sure</p></blockquote>
<p>As a <a href="http://www.divingidc.com/idc/">scuba instructor trainer</a>, I rely on accurate weather forecasts, and the data from BOM has generally been the most reliable for me.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/ios/pocketweatherau">Pocket Weather AU</a>.</p>

<p>Pocket Weather AU from Shifty Jelly provides data from BOM in an elegant, intuitive format. With location services enabled, the app provides real time data for your current location, as well as for other locations that you save.</p>
<p>The first screen shows a list of locations (you can have it launch straight to a default location if you prefer). Tapping on a location brings up a summary view for today. Swiping to the left brings a forecast view, while swiping right (from the summary view) brings up the weather radar. Swiping up on each of these screens will bring up more detail.</p>
<p>Aside from the beautiful UI and accurate data, my favourite feature is the <em>free</em> inclusion of tide information. Previously I had to purchase a separate tides app, which I had to repurchase each year. Pocket Weather AU allows the user to download the tide data from within the app, and have direct access to that.</p>
<p>Pocket Weather AU has other important features like access to weather warnings, and push notifications. This last feature allows you to see the current temperature for your default location on the app icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/ios/pocketweatherau">Pocket Weather AU</a> is a brilliant app for any Australian who needs accurate weather data in a classy, intuitive app.</p>
<p>The app is available for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>The universal iOS app is $1.99 in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-weather-australia/id546266910?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">App Store</a>.</p>
