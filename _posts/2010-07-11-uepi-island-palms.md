<p>Photo of the Day.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Starting today, my goal is to publish 1 new photo per day to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluebeyond">Flickr photostream</a> and to this blog.</p>
<p>This image was made at Uepi Island Resort in September 2009 during a wonderful week of diving and relaxing we had there.</p>
<p>Its the first HDR image I've published, so I'd appreciate any feedback.</p>
