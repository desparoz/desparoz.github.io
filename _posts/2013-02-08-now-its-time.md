<p><img id="iz" src="http://desparoz.me/uploads/2017/803546583d.jpg" alt="Inbox Zero: always a good feeling" align="right" />It’s always a great feeling to get back to <a href="http://djp.me/iz/">Inbox Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean the work is done. Just that the intrays are cleared, the work is processed into my system so I can now deal with stuff as I am best able.</p>
<p>The 36 starred items in the screen shot are all items lined up with items on my Next Action lists.</p>
<p>The in tray on my desk is also empty, I've cleared out all phone and SMS messages.</p>
<p>So Inbox Zero doesn’t imply that there’s no work to be done. On the contrary, it means that the work has been identified and organised appropriately. Now it’s time for me to get on with it!</p>
