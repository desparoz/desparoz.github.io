<p>This beautiful little nudibranch was a spectacular find during a dive near Tawali in PNG's Milne Bay Province.</p>
<p>I love the saturated colours and the spotted design of the nudibranch's back.</p>
<p>Finding small stuff like nudibranchs, many smaller than your little finger-nail, is one of the pleasures of diving. There can be more stuff living in a single square metre under water than in an entire backyard. It amazes me that so many divers rush about to see a huge area, and miss the special stuff.</p>
