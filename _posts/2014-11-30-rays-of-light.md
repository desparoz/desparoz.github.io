<p>Cairns in Far North Queensland is quite a magical place, being a jump off point to the northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef, as well as access to the Atherton Tablelands. The natural beauty of the city and its immediate surrounds is something that should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>I was up in Cairns for a training course in November 2014 and enjoyed a run or walk each day along the Esplanade, and also enjoyed taking my camera each time I could.</p>

<p>This morning I was a little after sunrise, but the weather actually made up for it, with a bit of rain then the intense light rays coming through the clouds, over the droplets of water.</p>

<p>I often tell people that the greatest epiphany I&#8217;ve had with my photography is that we don&#8217;t take pictures of things, but we take pictures <em>of</em> light â€“ the light reflected off subjects and negative space. </p>

<p>With that in mind, I like to keep an eye out for interesting light, so this morning in Cairns provided beautiful light.</p>
