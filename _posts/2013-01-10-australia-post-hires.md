<p>The AFR reports that Microsoftâ€™s Asia Pacific president <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/microsoft_chief_quits_to_join_australia_vXn9lmYMsPFbz7XzzdtlrO">Tracey Fellows will join Australia Post</a> to drive its strategy for digital services.
Sounds like a win/win to me. Aus Post gets an experienced executive, and Ms Fellows joins an organisation that has a commitment to an ongoing strategy to use technology to deliver real world differentiation.</p>
