<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/wAh1+" align="right">A week or two back, a new productivity app called <a href="http://appstore.com/mac/doodocumentorganizer"><em>doo</em> popped up in the Mac App Store</a>. Tagged as a way of accessing &quot;every document of your life&quot; wherever they are, in seconds, doo is a document organisation system that appeals to me as part of my quest for a paperless lifestyle. </p>
<p>I've been using Evernote as my primary document repository, but I have been growing increasingly wary about storing everything online in a third party system that stores documents in a proprietary format. Following the <a href="/blog/2013/03/03/evernotes-password-hack-and-the-security-of-your-stuff-in-the-cloud">attempted hack on Evernote user data</a>, I've made the decision to move any personal or business data that would be sensitive or confidential in nature back to a local database. I would prefer to be able to access key data <em>on-the-go</em>, so have been looking at systems like <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a>, <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a> and now <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">doo</a>.</p>
<p>I had installed doo last week with the intent of playing around with it a little, but since Sunday I've been gradually moving all the sensitiive Evernote data back to it. So far, it looks like a very powerful system that makes going paperless quite straightforward.</p>
<p>Today, Brooks Duncan of DocumentSnap has posted his initial <a href="http://www.documentsnap.com/doo-helps-you-manage-and-find-your-documents/">review of the doo Mac OSX</a> app. He gives what I think is the best description yet of doo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can think of it as a combination of Evernote and Dropbox, but unlike Evernote you can completely use the software without ever having to touch the web service, and unlike Evernote your documents do not get moved inside the application, and unlike Dropbox there is a nice local application to help you organize and find your documents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now doo has an OSX app and a Windows 8 app (interestingly, the Windows 8 version was launched several months ago, well before any other versions). In development are iOS and Android versions, as well as versions for other systems, including &quot;legacy Windows&quot;.</p>
<p>doo is free for local storage, and has a range of plans for their optional <em>doo Cloud</em> backup and sync services. There is a 30 day free trial of their 25GB sync plan.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that doo is in its early stages. Although not a beta release, I think that as the mobile apps come online, and as additional features are added, doo has the potential to become a very powerful organisation system, and could well be my flagship app for my paperless document management system.</p>
