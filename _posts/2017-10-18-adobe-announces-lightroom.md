Interested to see how the new <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/10/18/bye-bye-lightroom-hello-lightroom-cc-faster-lightroom-classic/">Lightroom CC suite</a> will work.

I was a long time Aperture user, and am yet to really warm to Lightroom. But if it becomes a powerful iOS, macOS &amp; cloud solution then it might become interesting.

Will look forward to reviews.
