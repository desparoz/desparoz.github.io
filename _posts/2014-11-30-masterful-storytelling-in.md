<p>Like most people who have a love for sci-fi, I eagerly watched <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/lucasfilm/starwarstheforceawakens/#share">the first trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a> yesterday. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>

<p><iframe id="video-frame" style="" height="340" scrolling="no" src="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/embed/starwarstheforceawakens/teaser/index.html" width="540"></iframe></p>

<p>After watching the trailer for the fifth or sixth time I started to really notice the masterful story-telling – exemplified in the words and tone; and the vision and music.</p>

<h2>Words and Tone</h2>

<p>In the entire 60 second clip there are only 15 words spoken:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been an awakening; have you felt it?</p>

<p>The dark side&#8230; And the light</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In those words we can see a couple clues:</p>

<ol>
<li>he dark and light sides of the force have been dormant since the timeline of <em>The Return of the Jedi</em></li>
<li>Both have awakened</li>
</ol>

<p>What was equally telling was the tone used – clearly the tone used was spoken from the darkside, with the voice over having a distinct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine">Emperor Palpatine</a> feel about it.</p>

<h2>Vision and Music</h2>

<p>The trailer starts with what appears to be the planet Tatooine <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> with some level of chaos as people and droids run from something. We then cut to an organised force of Stormtroopers amassing.</p>

<p>Ultimately we then see vision of what seems to be Han Solo&#8217;s spaceship, <em>Millenium Falcon</em> as the classic <em>Star Wars</em> score kicks in.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to the new movie<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>, and I am excited by what appears to be a strong foundation of masterful story-telling at the hands of JJ Abrams and crew.</p>
