Fraser Speirs (<a href="http://twitter.com/fraserspeirs">@fraserspeirs</a>) asks the question <a href="http://www.speirs.org/blog/2015/11/30/can-the-macbook-pro-replace-your-ipad">Can the MacBook Pro Replace Your iPad?</a>. In this article, Speirs focuses on the strengths of the iPad Pro, and then compares how the MacBook Pro meaures up. Some of his key points are interesting.

On the form factor…

<blockquote>
The fact that the keyboard and screen are limited to being held in an L-shaped configuration seriously limits its flexibility.
</blockquote>

Discussing input…

<blockquote>
The MacBook Pro continues to be hobbled by its lack of touch input.
</blockquote>

Considering battery life&#8230;

<blockquote>
Despite their far greater size, and consequently weight, there is no MacBook Pro model that gets better battery life than the iPad Pro.
</blockquote>

And on the topic of connectivity&#8230;

<blockquote>
If you are a road warrior, the MacBook&#8217;s total lack of cellular connectivity options would be a serious hinderance to a cloud-based storage lifestyle in any case.
