First you must fly to Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. Then a domestic flight to Seghe. Then a short walk through bush to the water's edge where you board a &quot;motorised canoe&quot; for the 40 minute ride to the very edge of Marovo Lagoon where Uepi is situated.<br />
<br />
Marovo Lagoon is the world's largest natural lagoon, and Uepi is on its very edge, near where it meets a deep ocean area called &quot;The Slot&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is the Welcome Jetty at Uepi. <br />
<br />
Uepi is isolated, wonderful and spectacular. I think it would be my single favourite diving destination.</p>
