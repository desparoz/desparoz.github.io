<blockquote>The promise of “unbundling”</p>
<p>Imagine a world in which your social data (e.g. messages, photos, videos) was easier to work with. For instance, imagine you could try out a new photo sharing service without having to move all of your photos and social graph.</p>
<p>In this world, your photos are held in a data store controlled by you. If you want to try out a new service, you can seamlessly login and choose to give permission to that service, and the photos that you have granted access to would be immediately available.</p>
<p>This is one benefit of an “unbundled” social service. Unbundling gives the user power to pick the software that best suits their needs, rather than being forced to use the software made by the company that manages their data.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been an <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">App.net</a> (also known as ADN for “App Dot Net”) user since early on - when they took the the concept to the people and offered something different - a model where <em>the users are the customers, not the product</em>. Unlike Twitter, Facebook and others, ADN does not rely on advertising revenue, and instead is a subscription service.</p>
<p>The addition of a wide <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">range of apps</a> was the first step in ADN getting traction. But an interesting thing started to happen - each developer started to add innovative features, as a result of direct communications with users. Although I primarily use <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/">Netbot for iOS</a> and <a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/50125136c4aa13a9a2853087/51552f40e4b0868e8c0e37e6/51552f7ce4b0868e8c0e3dad/1364537212412/#img">Wedge for OSX</a>, I actually use other apps for specific features.</p>
<p>The ADN team recognises the power of having an underlying layer for data storage and exchange, and a platform that allows developers to provide innovative front end features. They also recognise that the power for them, in their business model, is to let different users choose the apps that provide them the features they want.</p>
<p>I think that ADN should be firmly on the radar of serious users of social media, and of course <a href="http://www.warlach.com/2010/08/01/smeg-awareness/">SMEGs</a>.</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://alpha.app.net/desparoz">@desparoz</a> on ADN.</p>
