<p>The reason I&#8217;ve been so critical of iCloud lately is because I haven&#8217;t dismissed it.</p>

<p>This is in line with my thinking â€“ I have expectations that iCloud can be a real enabler. But it is true to say that Apple has had an extremely &#8216;two steps forward, 1.8 steps backwards&#8217; approach to its cloud based offerings.</p>

<p>I think we all need to be critical when Apple makes mistakes. They not always (even ever) publicly acknowledge their mistakes or the criticism, but their (recent) track records indicates that they do listen and act.</p>
