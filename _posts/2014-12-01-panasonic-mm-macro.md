<p>Yesterday I mentioned that my plans for gradually building up my m43 camera kit will ultimate include a <a href="http://desparoz.me/post/lensbaby-announces-a-new-5.8mm-fisheye-lens-for-m43">fisheye lens</a>. Another lens that will likely one day be part of my kit will be a good macro lens.</p>

<p>43rumors.com has recently reported that <a href="http://www.43rumors.com/panasonic-30mm-f2-8-macro-to-be-launched-in-q1/">Panasonic is planning to launch a 30mm macro lens in 2015</a>, complementing the existing 45mm macro and a 60mm model for m43 from Olympus.</p>

<p>A 30mm macro lens for m43 is equivalent to a 60mm lens in 35mm photography. A 60mm macro lens for my Nikon DLSRs was a go-to lens for me for many years, but in more recent times I spent more time on my 105mm macro lens.</p>

<p>I will certainly be looking into this lens, but I wonder if the 45mm m43 lens (a 90mm equivalent) might be a more versatile choice, espcially for my underwater shooting.</p>
