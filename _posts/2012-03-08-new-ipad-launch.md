<p>So the launch of the <strike>iPad 3</strike> <strike>iPad H</strike> "new" iPad has come and gone, and we have an exciting new iPad on the scene. For a quick review, I should start off with <a title="" target="_self" href="/blog/2012/03/07/my-ipad-launch-predictions">my predictions for the iPad 3 launch</a>, which I posted the night before the event. I'll add some commentary to each of these on my initial thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>1. iPad 3 with double pixel display, LTE and better cameras.</strong></p>
<p>Almost 100% right, but fairly obvious. Of course, it isn't an iPad "3", and it seems only one of the cameras is improved. But it is quite "<a href="http://www.apple.com/au/ipad/" target="_self" title="">resolutionary</a>".</p>
<p>Of course, the LTE (4G) functionality will be brilliant for those who work out of a set environment (like I do regularly), and the personal hotspot feature may actually save money (one less device to carry around, and one less mobile broadband account to pay for). It will be interesting to see if Telstra will allow that feature...</p>
<p>The double pixel display ("retina display") is going to be great for people who work in content. As I am writing this (on my iPad 2), I am also writing a couple of books, reviewing and preparing reports for consulting project clients, and regularly conducting <a href="http://DivingIDC.com" target="_self" title="">scuba diving and first aid instructor programs</a>. For all of these things, this is a great device.</p>
<p>There are of course other new features that are great, including the new Bluetooth capabilities.</p>
<p>So will I get one. Yes, but not immediately. I would pre-order one straight away if I didn't have an iPad 2, but am going to wait and see a little bit to see what Telstra does, and to play with one in store. The new iPad is great, but my iPad 2 is still brilliant, and I am good with that for now.</p>
<p><strong>2. iPhoto or Aperture for iPad</strong></p>
<p>Nailed this one. iPhoto made more sense than Aperture, because it rounds out the iLife suite on iOS.</p>
<p>This is a great app, and I am certainly going to play with it, and probably do a full review later during my iPads of March. The (pleasant) surprise in this for me was the fact that it is an iOS app that works nicely on the iPhone. I particularly like the ability to be able to send images between an iPhone and iPad, via WiFi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>3. Apple TV with HD Display</strong></p>
<p>Again, nailed it. Again, this was pretty obvious.</p>
<p>I do like the new UI design. Apple is clearly bringing the UX on devices like the Apple TV (and Mac) much closer to the iOS standard found on iPad and iPhone (yes, I know Apple TV is an iOS device, but previously the UX was quite different).</p>
<p>This new UX seems to lay a better foundation for future third party "app-ification" of the Apple TV.</p>
<p><strong>4. iTunes Movies (and possibly Television shows) in HD</strong></p>
<p>Done. Its good to see Apple getting behind 1080p. Of course, the new iPad and new Apple TV made that necessary. And vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>5. iOS 5.1</strong></p>
<p>Done. Again obvious. </p>
<p>Downloaded to 2 iPhones, an iPad and an Apple TV. Working well all round. The changes are most noticeable on the Apple TV, but some nice tweaks on other devices.</p>
<p>I look forward to better battery life.</p>
<p><strong>6. iWork '12, featuring built in iCloud support</strong></p>
<p>Should've been clearer that I was refering to the OSX version of iWork.</p>
<p>This was my "stretch prediction", and sadly it missed. I have to believe that it must be imminent. If Apple wants to continue to make inroads to corporate and institutional customers, it needs this integration to be seamless.</p>
<p>And it needs to do that before the rumoured <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/21/microsoft-office-on-ipad-spotted-coming-soon-to-app-store/" target="_self" title="">MS Office for iPad</a> is released.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>5 out of 6 predictions isn't too bad, but I admit that 4 of those (other than the iPhoto one) were pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Apple is clearly setting the scene with the tablet market space, and competitors are struggling to compete. Whilst there are other, competent, tablets out there, I reckon the "new iPad" will maintain number 1 position, by a mile, for the next year, and iPad 2 will be the number 2. The iPad 2 is clearly being targeted to more price sensitive markets, such as education.</p>
<p>Apple also released a slew of new and updated apps yesterday, including all iWork and iLife apps on iOS, and a number of OSX apps, including iLife and iBooks Author. I like the look of the new configurator app that allows centralised control of a fleet of iOS devices. Again, clearly a play for corporate and institutional customers.</p>
