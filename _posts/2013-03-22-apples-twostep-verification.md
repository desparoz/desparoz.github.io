<p>I was quite excited when I awoke this morning to find news that Apple has released <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/how-to-enable-two-step-verification-for-your-apple-id/">2 Factor authentication</a> for Apple ID. Apple seems to have done a good thing and built this into a "trusted device" upon which you use a feature in the Find My iPhone app, or receive an SMS each time you try to log-in. Sounds like a great approach, and it doesn't surprise me that Apple chose not to use the Google Authenticator.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5570"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT5570/HT5570_01-icloud-2stepfaq-001-en.png" alt="Apple 2 Factor" /></a></p>
<p>Following the <a href="/blog/2013/03/03/evernotes-password-hack-and-the-security-of-your-stuff-in-the-cloud">attempted hack on Evernote</a>, I made a determination that online service I use for personal/private/confidential "stuff" should support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_factor_authentication">2 factor authentication</a>. Heck, if Facebook could do it, what was stopping Evernote and Apple. Very quickly <a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=app.net%202%20factor&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.app.net%2F2013%2F03%2F13%2Fadded-security-for-your-app-net-account%2F&amp;ei=ZdBLUbWkAozOkwWOpICoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNENegsLr82EojZj9Bzi3IUjH0vf-w&amp;bvm=bv.44158598,d.dGI">App.net</a> rolled out 2 factor support, and today was Apple's turn. This was all part of my (perhaps peremptory decision to return to <a href="/blog/2013/03/08/my-return-to-google">return to Google</a>, something that following this and the GReadier debacle I am quickly reconsidering.</p>
<p>I went to the Apple ID site to set up <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5570"><em>two-step verification</em></a>, and immediately was asked to answer security questions. It's been a while, and for some reason I didn't record these in 1Password. Having had more than 1 best pal at school, I went for the backup plan, and had a password reset sent out to my alternate email address.</p>
<p>Of course, I setup new security questions, and then went in and changed my alternate email address to one that is not linked or forwarding to any other email address I have. I took the opportunity to really tighten the hatches.</p>
<p>Next I went back to complete the setup of the two-step verification process, and almost immediately received a block telling me to wait three days. They also mass emailed every linked email address I had.</p>
<p>I guess that I had just changed a lot of security settings, and this raised an alarm at Apple that perhaps I might be hacking, and potentially locking someone else out from their account, a la the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/">Mat Honan saga</a>. So I think that Apple has paid a good bit of attention to the process to ensure that unintended consequences are minimised. Three days gives plenty of time for a real owner to get an email and intervene if necessary.</p>
<p>So at this stage I can't provide a full review, but one thing that I noted from <a href="http://katiefloyd.me/blog/two-step-verification-for-your-apple-id">Katie Floyd's post</a> is that the two-step verification doesn't (yet) support iCloud services, such as Documents, Calendar, email, etc. I assume (hope) these will come shortly, but will require a lot of apps to be updated. Today's initial release was a good test for Apple, as the only app that needed to be updated was Find My iPhone.</p>
