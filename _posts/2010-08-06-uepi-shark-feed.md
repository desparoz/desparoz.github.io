<p>Shark Feeds, like this one at Uepi in the Solomon Islands, are an interesting affair. In the blue waters of the channel leading from the ocean into Marovo Lagoon, the Uepi people conduct occasional feeds.</p>
<p> This is an efficient way to get rid of some waste, as well as  an opportunity to build shark stocks in the area. Its also great as a photography opportunity.</p>
<p> On our shark dive, there were 15-30 sharks. It was the first time I had photographed a shark feed with an SLR, so I now know things I'd do differently if the opportunity arose again, in terms of camera settings.</p>
<p> This is not my greatest photo, technically, but it conveys the story of the shark feed quite well, so for me it is a keeper!</p>
