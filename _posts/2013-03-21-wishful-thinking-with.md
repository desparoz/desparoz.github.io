<p><a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/2013/03/welcome-mailbox/"><img style="float: right;" title="" src="https://d339l1rkauam1y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/maildropbox.png" alt="" width="300" height="" border="0" /></a>Perhaps its wishful thinking, but I wonder if I am alone in hoping that following the <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/2013/03/welcome-mailbox/">acquisition of Mailbox by Dropbox</a>, perhaps Dropbox will launch email hosting as part of its suite of offerings[^1] .</p>
<p>I love Dropbox - it's a vital tool in my personal file management, and I am proud to have been a <em>paid customer</em> for several years. I have implemented many features - shared folders (I have many of them), 2 factor authentication (one of my <a href="/blog/2013/03/03/evernotes-password-hack-and-the-security-of-your-stuff-in-the-cloud"><em>must-have</em> features in an online service</a>) and integration to a variety of iOS and OSX apps.</p>
<p>I must admit, one of the things I like about Dropbox is the fact that I am customer. Being a paid service, Dropbox benefits out of maintaining my business, which means providing me with a stable product that best meets my needs, and not using me and data they glean about me, to sell advertising (or sell to advertisers).</p>
<p>I've been enjoying using Mailbox on my iPhone, and it provides me with some features that are great - easy ability to clear my inbox down to what's important, then make it zero by clearing those things out. It also has a way of making things come back later, perhaps when I am in a better place to deal with them.</p>
<p>But there are one or two things that bugs me - Mailbox is effectively an extra point of failure between me and my mail. If their servers are down, I can't get my mail through the app - although at least I can get the mail through normal Gmail means. It also relies on Gmail, and like many people I am nervous about relying on gmail following the <em>GReadier</em> debacle. It's also a free app, so I'm nervous about trusting it - but at least I have workarounds.</p>
<p>If Dropbox were to build a new email system from ground up, and <em>use the front end features of Mailbox as a guide to the "UX" (user experience)</em>, this could make for interesting days. I'd love to see it as a paid service, part of the Dropbox Pro offering. Obviously the ability to map your own domain would be a necessity, but could be for a further premium.</p>
<p>This may be speculative and wishful, but it makes more and more sense as I think about it. I would move off Google Apps in a heartbeat if there was another offering that was similarly feature rich, but without the creepiness factor.</p>
