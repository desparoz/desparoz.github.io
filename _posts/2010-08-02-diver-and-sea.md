<p>As with most of the dive sites at Uepi in the Solomon Islands, Kurukuru features wall diving. The walls here start at the surface, and drop down to 2000m and deeper.</p>
<p> Coral growth along the walls is spectacular, with gorgonian fans all around.</p>
<p> The saturated reds of this fan complemented the deep blues of the ocean so nicely, and the diver (my wife Belinda) gives a sense of scale.</p>
<p> Some photographers prefer to not have bubbles in the image. I like them in - its a safety factor (divers should never hold their breath), and it shows what actually happens (people do breath). What I try to do is time the image so the bubbles are away from the diver's face.</p>
