<p>These are links I've gathered from my wanderings around the web for 25th January</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-email-should-become-obsolete-2013-1">Why Email Should Become Obsolete - Business Insider</a>  - &quot;Email is all about containing knowledge, putting it in defined boxes. That&#039;s the wrong way to go about it. Information and knowledge are much more powerful when people can easily access it, then collaborate and build upon it.&quot; Sounds like the logic behind the ill-fated Google Wave. Although the idea is good in principle, people like containers. I think email will continue to be an important tool for the foreseeable future!</li>
</ul>
