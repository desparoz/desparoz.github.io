Made during our recent trip to <a href="http://www.desparoz.com/tag/singapore/">Singapore</a>, this image shows two of the iconic sights around the Downtown Core of this beautiful city.

On the left is the <a href="xlink">Singapore Flyer</a>, the second largest ferris wheel in the world.

On the right is the fabulous <a href="http://www.marinabaysands.com/museum.html#hgkHK2uJYSkhsgA1.97">ArtScience Museum</a>, which was built to resemble the shape of a lotus flower. While we were there we particularly enjoyed the &#8216;NASA: A Human Journey&#8217; exhibition.

The ArtScience Museum is part of the beautiful Marina Bay Sands area. In many ways the ArtScience Museum visually and functionally represents Singapore itself - a unique blend of modern science and traditional culture.

This image was made in the mid-afternoon, and a circular polariser was a key part of creating it.
