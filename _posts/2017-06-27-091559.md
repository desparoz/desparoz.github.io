<p><em>A thought in reply to: <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3203024/photography/the-ipad-pro-now-a-true-photographer-s-tool.html">iPad Pro for Photography</a>...</em></p>I look forward to iPad Pro being a core tool in my photography workflow.

The things that will be the tipping point for me are:

<ol>
<li><em>Good</em> DAM (digital asset management) apps for iOS. Lightroom is getting there, a Photos is ok, but we shall see where things go.</li>
<li>MacPhun Luminar or similar apps with really intuitive editing.</li>
<li>Easy import of images from a camera (not every photo is made on an iPhone)â€¦</li>
</ol>
