With the sun set for the day, the crowds along Darwin&#8217;s shoreline had begun to go home, but some people stayed to enjoy the &#8216;blue hour&#8217;, a time when the sky provides some magical colour - if you keep an eye open for it. Or a lensâ€¦.

This image is a composite of three images made while the camera was on a stable tripod, with each image being quite a long exposure, and then processed in Aurora HDR software.

The effect of the long exposures is to render a silky smoothness to what was actually a slightly choppy sea.

The blue hour is a great time for photography - different that the golden hour that occurs on the other side of the sun rise/set, and shooting both can provide some interesting variety in the space of a couple of hours.

As a matter of interest, compare this to &#8216;<a href="https://500px.com/photo/160662593/red-jetty-by-des-paroz">Red Jetty</a>&#8217;, an image which was captured at the same location just as the sun was setting.
