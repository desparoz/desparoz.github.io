<p>Mudgee is a town about 4 hours west of Sydney. A picturesque country town, Mudgee is a great escape with many great restaurants, vineyards, cheese places, etc.</p>
<p>Its also very photogenic, with several old churches and buildings.</p>
<p>This image was made on a cool winters morning just before sunrise, and is of course an HDR image composited of three exposures.</p>
<p>I love the saturated colours you can capture from the combination of HDR and the muted early morning light.</p>
