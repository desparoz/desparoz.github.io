<p>My friend and mentor <a href="http://precisiondiving.com/">Grant W Graves</a> is not only a diving guru<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> but is also a degree qualified marine scientist. In the diving world, Grant is one of the foremost connectors in the industry. He literally knows everyone in diving.</p>

<p>Last December Grant launched a new initiative—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwnPbmzPZ6uLkxKxkmVg2H_5ZFHIdJkW">Soggy Science</a>. Soggy Science is a weekly video roundup of news about the aquatic world. </p>
