<p>I&#8217;ve been away on work related stuff for the last few weeks, and am catching up on lots of things.</p>

<p>This morning I listened to the <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2013/11/17/mac-power-users-164-tackling-email/">MacPower Users podcast episode on Email</a>, which was a really good indepth study on the state of play of best practice in email management. Well worth a listen.</p>

<p>Prior to listening to that episode, I started reading <a href="http://macsparky.com/">David Sparks&#8217;</a> latest book: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/email/id743560201?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4Ky"><em>Email - A MacSparky Field Guide</em></a><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>I plan to review this book, but I want to finish reading it first. First impressions are fantastic. In the meantime, go listen to <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2013/11/17/mac-power-users-164-tackling-email/">Episode 165 of MacPower Users</a> where David and <a href="http://katiefloyd.me">KatieFloyd</a> talk about the ins, outs and best practices of the email beast!</p>
