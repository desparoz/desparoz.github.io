  <p><em>The following review was originally published on my website BlueBeyond.com.au. I’ve decided to move it over here for reference.</em></p>

<p>There is one underwater photography book that has journeyed with me on every dive trip I’ve made over the past 8 years. Although I’ve read Martin Edge’s <em>The Underwater Photographer</em> from cover to cover several times over, it has always proved to be a valuable source of information and inspiration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EVWKI3M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EVWKI3M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bluebeyond-20&amp;linkId=I6GZ4IR7P43NQSEC"><img src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00EVWKI3M&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=bluebeyond-20" alt="" align="right" border="0" /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=bluebeyond-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00EVWKI3M" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />
Now reprised in its third edition, author Martin Edge has embraced the digital era, giving succinct and usable information pertinent to every underwater photographer - seasoned or novice, using digital or film, compact or SLR.</p>

<p>Practical information is provided right from the outset, with Martin providing “thoughtful and considered” information. This is the crux of why I like this book so much - Edge focuses on his “think and consider” approach, and provides insights into his thinking as he makes an image. Technical information is provided to support the TC Approach, and is not in itself the central theme of the book.</p>

<p>Having embraced the digital revolution, Edge shares his own thoughts about the pro’s and con’s of digital imaging, equipment and settings. Practical, pertinent guidance is provided in an easy to understand way.</p>

<p>One of the impressive things about Edge is that shows how his own photography has changed over the years. As an example, he has openly modified recommendations about strobe positioning between the 2nd and 3rd Editions. An open mind is the hallmark of success in many endeavours, and Edge clearly displays this attitude as a leader in the world of marine imaging.</p>

<p>For me, <em>The Underwater Photographer - Digital and Traditional Techniques</em> is a book that should be on the reading and reference list for all aspiring and experienced underwater photographers.</p>
