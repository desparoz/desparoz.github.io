  <p>This blog, Des Paroz On The Go, has existed for many years (since c. 2003) and has had a consistent following among people interested in my thoughts and observations about marketing, business, technology, personal productivity and the online world.</p>
<p>Since moving out of a fulltime career in the IT industry in 2008, I've been building a business in vocation training and business development. My focus is on the recreational scuba diving industry, as I conduct PADI Instructor Development Courses and various other PADI, EFR, DAN and TecRec courses at the diver and instructor level.</p>
<p>A key focus for me is in developing dive and other outdoor recreation professionals with key skills in areas such as customer services and business, along with training skills.</p>
<p>So this blog is being relaunched to focus on business, the customer experience, personal productivity and technology that pertain to providing great customer service, in any industry. I'll discuss experiences as a customer, and my perceptions of marketing.</p>
<p>I look forward to interaction and discussion on these topics.</p>
